<p><b>Bashar </b>is a male member of a 5th dimensional civilization called the<b> 
  Essassani</b>. This is an "informal" "unofficial" concentrated summary by Iasos 
  of some of the core concepts of Bashar, based on listening to innumerable recordings of his talks, and also reading his two books <b>"Quest for 
  Truth" </b>and <b>"Bashar: Blueprint for Change". </b>The entire Essassani civilization 
  is based on unconditional love, ecstasy, fun, following your excitement, being 
  totally non-judgmental, and giving validity and equality to the uniqueness of each individual 
  in their society. Even the Pleiadians look up to the Essassani civilization as being exceptionally spiritually-advanced. Bashar - as experienced from the recordings of the channelings - is 
  <u>extremely</u> enthusiastic - almost to the point of seeming cartoon-like! 
  And yet he has an incredibly fast mind, an amazing wit, extreme intelligence, a loving heart, and 
  of course a<strong> profound</strong> understanding of reality. </p>

<p><span class="style24"><span class="style21"><font size="+1">2&nbsp; Everything is Here/Now.</font></span>&nbsp; </span><br>

  Just as each tiny section of a hologram contains the information for the

  Everything is truly just one totally-interconnected "thing".</p>
<p><span class="style10"><font size="+1">4</font><font size="+1">&nbsp; What you put out is what you get back.</font></span><span class="style21">&nbsp;
</span><br>
 The "outside" is a reflection of the "inside". <br>
 Physical reality is actually a 3-dimensional holographic mirror: &nbsp;<br>
 Your physical reality is just
a holographic reflection of<br>
what you most strongly <u>believe</u> to be true.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
like a mirror, physical reality<br>
will not change unless <u>you</u> change first (change what you most strongly
believe).</p>

  <hr>
  <p><span class="style30"><span class="style50"><span class="style62">The Formula</span><br>
The Essassani "Instruction Manual"</span></span></p>
  <p>This formula is the concentrated distillation of all the Essassani wisdom of "how life works" into one simple formula. <br>
    This is not philosophy or religion.   This is based on the<strong> physics</strong> of how reality actually works.
  </p>
  <p align="left"><span class="style13"><br>
  #1. <span class="style63">Act on your Excitement</span>, your Passion - whatever is most exciting to you - in the moment. &nbsp;Do this every moment that you can.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Excitement is your Higher Self, pointing you in a particular direction, hoping you move in that direction.U) </span></p>
  <p align="left">#2. <span class="style63">Do this to the best of your ability</span>. Take it as far as you can go - until you can not take it any further. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Make sure your beliefs are not causing you to dampen your excitement ahead of time.) </p>
  <p align="left">#3. Act on your Excitement/Passion with <span class="style63">absolutely no insistence or assumption or expectation of what the <strong>outcome</strong> should be</span>.<br>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Very often the ideal outcome will <em><strong>not</strong></em> be what you expect or intend. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Higher Self knows the ideal outcome, but your physical mind can not really know that in advance.</p>
  <p align="left">#4. Choose to <span class="style63">remain in a positive state - regardless of what happens</span>. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    If something undesireable happens, by remaining in a positive state even then, you are able to gain some positive benefit from that situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remain in a positive state, you can discover HOW it can serve you in a beneficial manner. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any circumstance is actually neutral, with no built-in meaning. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;You</strong> deteremine whether it has a positive or negative effect, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on the MEANING that you PROJECT into that fundamentally-neutral situation.</p>
  <p align="left">#5. <span class="style63">Constantly investigate your belief systems</span>, and release &amp; replace the unpreferred beliefs:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The fear-based beliefs you might have.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* And the beliefs that are not in alignement with who you prefer to be. </p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    FOLLOWING THIS FORMULA - as precisely as you can - activates <span class="style63"><strong>synchronicity</strong></span> which is the organizing principle of the entire universe.<br>
    (Synchronicity is the "networking" and coordination of all parts of the universe with each other - through the one Universal Mind.) <br>
    And so, by activating this synchronicity, automatically, things in your life flow more naturally, pleasantly, and desirably for you - and in perfect timing. </p>

<p>All things are Spirit vibrating at different frequencies. Matter is
solidified energy. Matter is Spirit energy vibrating at a slower frequency.
<b>Your body is solidified Spirit</b>, crystallized Spirit. Your Spirit
is not in your body. <b>Your body is in your Spirit.</b> As you raise your
vibrations, you become more Spirit-like, moving closer towards fluid-like
Spirit, thereby making your reality creation more malleable and easily
changeable. </p>

<center><p><a name="Receiving" id="Receiving"></a>
</p><hr width="100%"><font color="#FF00FF"><font size="+2">"Receiving"
the Reality you Desire</font></font> <p></p></center>

<p>A radio does not have to <u>create</u> the program it wishes to hear.
It merely needs to <u>receive</u> an already-existing program. And it makes
itself an effective receiver by <u>matching frequencies</u>, synchronizing
frequencies - creating a <u>similarity of vibrations</u> - with the program&nbsp;&nbsp;it wishes to receive. </p>

<p>Likewise, you don't have to <u>create</u> the reality you desire, because
it already exists - among the infinite probable realities all simultaneously
co-existing.&nbsp; All you have to do is make yourself an effective "antenna",
so that by similarity of vibrations, you can <u>receive</u> that reality.
And this makes it physiologically "real" for you. </p>

<center><p><font color="#FF00FF"><u>First</u>, you have to <u>be</u> that
vibration.</font> <font color="#FF00FF"><u>Then</u>, you automatically
<u>receive</u> that reality.</font> </p></center>
<p>You must "see" the reality you prefer as <u>now</u> existing
in the moment. Then, it will become tangible in your outer reality. </p>

<p>A radio uses a channel tuner to select &amp; receive any one particular
station - out of all the programs that are simultaneously existing all
around the radio. </p>

<p>Likewise, there are infinite probable realities that we could "receive"
and experience at any moment. <b>How</b> do we select which one of these
we wish to "pull" to the foreground to experience ? </p>

<center><p><font color="#FF00FF">We select and receive specific "versions"
of reality by our <b>beliefs</b>.</font> <br>
<font color="#FF00FF">We select and receive by our <b>100% trust</b> in
"what we <u>know</u> is so".</font> </p>
  <p align="left" class="style30">Useful metaphor:</p>
  <p align="left">Let's say you have many light bulbs - each of a different color. By themselves, each light bulb can not light up - until it is screwed into a socket. The socket provides the <strong>energy</strong> to "activate" the colored light bulb.<br>
    Without the socket, the colored light bulbs can do nothing.<br>
    <br>
    Well, each belief is like a light bulb. And YOU are the socket (the energizng source that "activates" any particular belief ). <br>
    <br>
    So, if you wish to change your belief, imagine unscrewing that belief (disconnecting its energy source) from its socket (YOU and YOUR ENERGY).<br>
    And then imagine screwing in your <em><strong>preferred </strong></em>belief  into that socket.(thus activating it with YOUR ENERGY)<br>
    It's that easy. </p>
  <p align="left">Just remember:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By itself, each belief has no energy and can do nothing. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The belief only "activates" when YOU energize it with YOUR energy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And YOU and ONLY YOU get to select <em><strong>which</strong></em> belief you wish to energize. </p>

<center><p>Here's the<font size="+2"> "physics" of how this works:
</font></p></center>

<p>Just as a radio must <u>first</u> vibrate at a particular frequency
in order to "receive" the one particular broadcast (from all
of the possible simultaneous broadcasts) that happens to be vibrating at
that <u>same</u> frequency, likewise... </p>

<center><p><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Each belief gets you vibrating at a
unique set of frequencies</b>.<br>
These frequencies then attract, by sympathetic resonance, those holograms
vibrating<br>
on the <u>same</u> frequencies.</font></p></center>

<p><font color="#0000C8">That is, out of the "background" universal
matrix of infinite possible holograms (all of the infinite possible "versions"
of reality that&nbsp;are simultaneously existing), those holograms and
symbols that synchronistically vibrate at the <u>same</u> frequencies as
the frequencies of your belief, get "pulled out" from this matrix
and "received" by you as the actual "external physical experiences"
that you then sense as "real" - that you sense as "objective
reality".</font></p>

<p><font color="#0000C8">So each belief is a unique set of frequencies
which is a <b>template</b> that determines which holograms you attract
into your experience.</font></p>

<p>What we believe<font color="#0000A0"> </font>and
totally "trust to be so<font color="#0000C8">"</font>, sets up the alignment from which
we receive that particular "version" of reality. This trust or
"knowing" is the mechanism by which creation takes place. Without
believing, we would create no reality and be non-existent.&nbsp; At every
given moment, we are always totally believing <u>something</u>. </p>

<p>All possible "versions" of your reality <u>already</u> exist.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, they are <u>all</u> here - right under your
nose - right <u>Here</u>, right <u>Now</u>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
most of these "versions" are invisible to us, and they become
"visible" only when we "tune" ourselves (via our <b>beliefs</b>),
to be compatible and resonant with the frequencies of any one particular
"version".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, since Time is only
a local "illusion" that does not really exist, everything you
ever hope to "become" or "attain", you have <u>already</u>
become and attained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's "invisible" to
you, that's only because your <b>beliefs</b> do not yet have you vibrating
in a manner that is synchronous with those versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; You contain
it ALL - all possible "versions". &nbsp;&nbsp; And all these
here/now versions are in various states of visible/invisible for you, depending
on your <b>beliefs</b> relative to any particular version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You "see" and "objectively experience" the versions
that are synchronized with how you are vibrating, and it's your <b>beliefs</b>
at any given moment that determine how you are vibrating.</p>

<p>In a hologram, each <u>part</u> of the hologram contains the information
for the <u>whole</u> hologram. &nbsp;The universe is structured holographically.
&nbsp;You are holographic. Each possible "version" of your reality
is also holographic. &nbsp;&nbsp; You contain within you <u>all</u> possible
versions of reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;All holograms (versions of reality) are
contained within you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all these infinite possibilities,
you "select" the version to be experienced with your beliefs,
imagination, and feelings. &nbsp;&nbsp;Your <b>imagination</b> is the "archive"
of all your possible holograms.&nbsp;&nbsp;From this archive of possibilities,
the version that you "imagine" (believe, or focus your imagination
on) is your currently-selected version of reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
you "activate" this selected version with your <b>feelings</b>.
The more intense the feelings, the more powerfully you activate this version,
and therefore, the more quickly it manifests as your tangible reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Positive feelings activate the positive desired versions. Negative
feelings activate the negative undesired versions (the dreaded outcomes).&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style51"><a href="https://iasos.com/metaphys/abraham/" target="_blank"><br>

<p>Your <b>beliefs</b> are the result of what you <b>imagine</b>, and then

<font color="#FF00FF"><font size="+2">receiving the "version" of
reality you prefer:</font></font> <br>
<br>
<font size="+1">1. See it. </font>(mental) <p></p></center>

<p>Visualize it. Imagine it. Daydream it. Visualize it clearly. You don't
need to visualize it for a long time. Short time is sufficient, but you
need to visualize it <b>clearly</b>. You need to have a solid clear picture.
Visualizing it creates the blueprint, so see it in great detail. &nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1"><u>See
it</u> ==&gt; </font>Become an efficient <font size="+1"><u>Mental Antenna</u>
</font>to receive this "version" of reality.</p>

<center><p><font size="+1">2. Feel it. </font>(emotional) </p></center>

<p>Get excited &amp; passionate about it! How would you feel if you had
it now? Feel that now! Plug into your vision with all your emotions &amp;
all your senses, as if you had it now! Involve all your senses - imagine
smelling it, touching it, tasting it, etc. <br>
<font size="+1"><u>Feel it</u> ==&gt; </font>Become an efficient <font size="+1"><u>Emotional
Antenna</u> </font>to receive this "version" of reality.</p>

<center><p><font size="+1">3. Be it. </font>(physical) </p></center>

<p>Physical action. Do it! To ground the experience. Do actions that most
closely mimic the actions you "see" yourself doing in your vision.
Gather and use whatever props mimic that scenario, and do a "dry run".
Doing this "make believe" physical action trains the body consciousness.
This makes it "real for you now", so the universe then delivers
it to you. NOTE: This physical action does not directly <u>cause</u> this
desired reality to manifest. Instead, <b>this physical action creates a
more precise vibration in yourself, making you a better antenna to <u>receive</u>
it</b>, by you becoming more aligned to the same vibration. The reality
you desire already exists. You do not have to create it. You only have
to receive it. <br>
<font size="+1"><u>Be it</u> ==&gt; </font>Become an efficient <font size="+1"><b>Physical
</b><u>Antenna</u> </font>to receive this "version" of reality.</p>

<p>In other words,</p>

<ul>
  <font size="+1">1. See it. &nbsp;===&gt; </font>Become a precise <b>mental &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;antenna</b> 
  to "receive" that version of reality.<br>

  <p align="left">Since you contain EVERYTHING, and all possible versions of your

    therefore <i>already</i> have <i>everything</i> you desire or could ever desire. 
    You contain it <u>all</u>!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have already been given everything 
    you could ever hope to have or want.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just that it may 
    not be "visible" (and therefore "real") to you.</p>
  <p align="left">Creation all exists Here-Now, outside time, in one eternal-Now

    but in varying states of visibility/invisibility </b>- depending on the frequencies

  <p align="left">When you "pray" for something, you do not need to 
    pray to<b> get</b> something you do not already have, since it's already right

    you can <b>see</b> that you already have it, then your vibration <b>frequency-matches 
    </b>the vibration of that which you desire.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="left">And once you frequency-match 
    with that which you desire, then it <i>has</i> to manifest in your reality! &nbsp;Everything is energy. &nbsp;You can not help but then get that reality, 
    because that's the physics of how the universe works. &nbsp;&nbsp;When you 
    match-frequencies with what you desire, you will then see that it has always 
    been "right here", just waiting for you to notice it and start enjoying

  <p align="center"><span class="style9">2 quick Techniques for Manifesting your preferred Reality </span></p>
  <p align="left" class="style22">First quick Technique</p>
  <p align="left">1. Get a clear <strong>Vision</strong> or <strong>Intention</strong> of what you would like your preferred Reality (your preferred Life) to be like.<br>
    2. Because you simply exist, you automatically <strong>Deserve</strong> everything you may want.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Accordingly, make sure you feel you <strong>Deserve</strong> this preferred Reality.<br>
    3. What would be the <strong>Beliefs</strong> of someone <em><strong>already</strong></em> experiencing precisely this Reality? <br>
    4. Adopt those <strong>Beliefs</strong>.<br>
    5. When events-contradicting-this-belief come up, or when Beliefs come up that are in contradiction to your recently-adopted beliefs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Do not be in denial. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Acknowledge and own these disempowered Beliefs.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;(Because you can not change what you do not "own".) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Realize that these disempowered Beliefs and your recently-adopted beliefs are both <strong>equally-real</strong>, equally-valid, and you contain them both. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. With this realization, simply choose to <em><strong>express</strong> </em>your <strong>preferred </strong>recently-adopted beliefs. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Since you already contain ALL beliefs, you don't need to "get rid of" the undesired beliefs. Simply <em><strong>express</strong></em> the preferred beliefs.) <br>
6. <strong>Feel</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the way someone would feel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is already experiencing this preferred Reality. <br>
7. <strong>Think</strong>&nbsp; the way someone would think&nbsp; that is already experiencing this preferred Reality.<br>
8. <strong>Act</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way someone would act &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is already experiencing this preferred Reality.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left" class="style1"><strong><span class="style21">Second quick Technique</span> - "The Referential Preferential You"</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="style1"><span class="style13">1.
    Conjure up in your imagination, the ideal or divine or perfect or ultimate version of yourself. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(If you find this difficult, then imagine your favorite Divine being instead.)     <br>
    2. In your imagination, put this "ideal you" or "Divine being" into this preferred Reality situation.<br>
    3. Watch in your imagination, how the "ideal you" or "Divine being" &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>feels</strong>, <strong>thinks</strong>, and <strong>acts</strong> in this  preferred Reality situation.<br>
    4. Simply <strong>COPY</strong> that behavior:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. <strong>Feel&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way the "ideal you" or "Divine being" is feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in this preferred Reality situation.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. <strong>Think </strong>&nbsp;the way the "ideal you" or "Divine being" is thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in this preferred Reality situation<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. <strong>Act</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way the "ideal you" or "Divine being" is acting &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this preferred Reality situation.<br>

  <p align="center" class="style9">Visualization - how to do it effectively</p>
  <div align="left">
    <p>This explains the Mechanics of how to <em><strong>effectively</strong></em> manifest what you are visualizing and wishing to manifest. </p>
    <p><strong>Remember:</strong><br>
    The physical mind is not designed to know <strong>HOW</strong> something will manifest, or <strong>what it will look like</strong> when it does manifest. <br>
    But you <em>can</em> use it to decide what you want. </p>
    <p>Your visualization is simply a symbolic <em><strong>representation</strong></em> of a <strong>state of being</strong>, whose purpose is to generate <strong>Excitement</strong> within you. But it may not manifest in the form you are visualizing. </p>
    <div align="center">
      <table width="49%" border="5" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="6">
        <tbody><tr>
          <td height="89" nowrap=""><p><span class="style10">Step 1:</span><br>
  You create the most vivid visualization of what you want, that you can.<br>
  And you get really <strong>excited </strong> about it. </p>
            <p><span class="style10">Step 2:<br>
            </span><span class="style12">You<strong> GIVE </strong> that visualization and that excited state of being to your <strong>Higher Mind</strong>. </span> </p>
            <p><span class="style10">Step 3:</span><br>
  Then, you TOTALLY<strong> LET-GO</strong> of any need, that it manifest in the form you were visualizing. <br>
  (But you do "hold on" to that excited state of being associated with that visualization.)</p></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody></table>
    </div>
    <p>So you <strong>Let-Go </strong> that visualization, and <strong>Give </strong> the visualization and that excited state of being to your <strong>Higher Mind</strong> - which <em><strong>does</strong></em> understand <em><strong>HOW</strong></em> that can come into manifestation.</p>
    <p>This way, your <strong>Higher Mind</strong> can produce for you a manifestation that does correspond with the excited state you gave it, but which, in specific form, is <strong><em>much better </em></strong> and <em><strong>more profound </strong></em> than the details of your specific visualization. Your <strong>Higher Mind</strong> can produce a manifestation that is far greater than what the human mind can ever imagine - by a long shot!</p>
    <p>So don't prevent your Higher Mind from giving you something profoundly-better than your visualization, by <em>insisting </em> that it " <strong><em>must </em></strong>" manifest only in the form you are visualizing. </p>
    <p>Remember to <strong>Give</strong> the visualization to your Higher Mind, and then <strong>Let go</strong> of the need that it manifest in the form you were visualizing. </p>

    <p align="center"><font color="#FF00FF"><font size="+2">Shifting between Parallel Realities </font></font></p>
    <div align="left">
      <p>There are infinite versions of reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;There are infinite parallel realities, and they are all equally "real", though you experience only 1 version at any given moment. </p>
      <p>Shifting from one version to another is not really that unnatural or difficult, since you are doing it all the time anyway - billions of times every second. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's not so much a matter of"making it happen". &nbsp;It's more a matter of directing or "steering" <em><strong>which</strong></em> parallel reality you shift into - at any moment. &nbsp;Shifting parallel realities is akin to films changing still-pictures 24 times per second, or video changing still-pictures 25 or 30 times per second.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It happens so fast, that it creates the illusion of smooth continuous motion.  </p>
      <p>When you shift to another version of reality, you become the "you" that already existed in that version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the "you" in the version you just left, is still "real" and still "there". </p>
      <p>Since <strong>EVERYTHING is CONSCIOUSNESS</strong>, and<br>
      Since <strong>YOU are EVERYTHING</strong>,</p>
      <p align="center" class="style21"><strong>Shifting from one parallel reality to another is like "closing your eyes" in one version and "opening your eyes" in another version.</strong></p>
      <p>Shifting from one parallel reality to another is like "viewing through the window of another you" and no longer "viewing through the window of the previous you".</p>
      <p>But keep in mind that this "new you" and the "previous you" are still both "real", and have both always existed..........since YOU are EVERYTHING and YOU have ALWAYS EXISTED. </p>
      <p>So shifting parallel realities boils down to the YOU-that-is-EVERYTHING &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;<span class="style21">shifting the perspective</span></strong><span class="style21"> </span>or <strong></strong><span class="style21"><strong>point-of-view</strong></span> from which it's viewing a part of its EVERYTHING-SELF. </p>
      <p>And sensing yourself as everything is not <strong>losing your identity</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, it is <strong>expanding </strong>your self-identity to<strong> include EVERYTHING</strong>. <br>

<p align="left">First, let go of the unnecesary belief that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>Beliefs are hard to Change</em>".</p>
<p align="left"> Your beliefs steer which way your reality - your life - goes. <br>
But your beliefs do not have any energy of their own. <br>

Bashar's analogy: </p>

    Each belief is like a light bulb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has no energy of its own. <br>
    YOU are the <span class="style55"><em>only</em></span> energy source (the electrical socket)&nbsp; for each belief (each light&nbsp; bulb). <br>
    <br>
    So, if you notice you have a belief you don't prefer: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left" class="style1">	Simply unscrew that undesired light bulb&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(the disempowering belief) <br>

<p></p></center>

<p>In a theater that shows many plays, there may be some props back-stage
that are frequently used for several different plays. For each play that
prop has a special meaning, but outside that play, the prop has no innate
intrinsic built-in meaning. All the props are basically without meaning.
From this innate absence of meaning, we can assign any meaning we want
to them. </p>

<p>Likewise, all the events that you experiencing as "happening"
in your life are "neutral props". </p>

<center><p><font color="#FF0080">Each event you experience has no innate
intrinsic built-in meaning.</font> </p>
</center>

<p>These events are blank, neutral, no innate significance. And from this
"blank slate", we get to assign any significance or meaning we
wish for each event we experience. <br>
Normally, we assign and "project" a meaning onto a neutral situation <em><strong>so
quickly</strong></em> and <em><strong>so automatically</strong>, </em> that we
are not even aware that we are doing it.<br>
We "think" the interpretation or "meaning" is "built into" that situation. We
are usually totally oblivious of that fact that <u>we</u> are the ones that are
assigning a very specific meaning<br>
to what is actually a "neutral" event, with no built-in inherent meaning. <br>

  <font color="#FF00FF"><font size="+2">Follow your excitement!</font></font> &nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF00FF" size="+2"><br>
  Finding your Purpose in Life. </font> 
  <p></p></center>

<p>Act on it! Excitement is caused by a resonance with your Higher Self.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Excitement is a "sign" that the activity you are contemplating is 
  aligned with your Higher Self, and this alignment is what <u>causes</u> the 
  excitement.&nbsp; This naturally leads you to what you are "meant" 
  to be doing - what your Soul "hopes" your  free-will chooses to 
  do. This is your "<font color="#FF00FF">Purpose</font>". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So 
  this is the simple yet effortlessly-effective way to find your life's "<font color="#FF00FF">Purpose</font>".</p>

<p>Mechanically, "excitement" is a high state of resonant-excitation
that occurs when the Thinking+Intentions of the physical dimension self
are sharply aligned with the Thinking+Intentions of its own Higher Self.</p>

<p>So excitement serves as a "compass" - to let you know when
you're "on course" - when you are doing or contemplating doing
<i>exactly</i> what your Higher Self would just <b><i>love</i></b> to have
you be doing.</p>

<p>When you follow your excitement, and do what excites you, this means
that : </p>

<ul>
  <b>1.</b> This activity is <font color="#FF00FF">"you"</font> (truly 
  aligned with your Soul). <br>
  <b>2.</b> Because it is "you", this activity is <font color="#FF00FF">effortless</font> 
  for you. <br>
  <b>3.</b> Because it is "you", the <font color="#FF00FF">universe</font><font color="#EA00EA"> 
  </font><font color="#FF00FF">will support you</font> (including financial support) 
  to continue doing this, in progressively more expanding ways.
</ul>
<p>Following your excitement is following the "signs" your Higher Self 
  is giving - to lead you in the most DIRECT way possible to what it "hopes" 
  your free-will will choose to do, which is the same as your life's Purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  The catch is this: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Even if following your excitement means doing something seemingly 
    trivial and unprofound, even <em>then</em>, just do it! &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because proceeding towards doing this seemingly mundane thing, might lead you 
  to meet someone, or discover something, that is just "perfect" for 
  furthering your Life's purpose. </p>
<p>IMPORTANT consideration:<br>
  <font color="#FF00FF"><strong> "Follow your Excitement - with INTEGRITY".</strong></font> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bashar defines "integrity" to mean, NOT any particular 
  moral standard, but instead: Realizing that everything is a whole (integer), 
  and you are one with the whole. And therefore, (Golden Rule), you treat everyone 
  and everything with the same respect and consideration and care that you would 
  want them to treat you.</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#FF00FF"><strong>"Follow your Excitement - 
  <u>with INTEGRITY</u>".</strong></font> </p>
<p align="left"><strong>1</strong>. Of all the available options, ACT on the option that has the highest Excitement, that you can do with Integrity.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.</strong> Act on this option as best as you - to your fullest ability. When you can act no further on this option, then (once again), ACT on the option that <em>then </em>has the highest Excitement, that you can do with Integrity.<br>
  <strong><br>
  3.</strong> <span class="style55">Do not <em><strong>insist</strong></em> that the outcome be what you expect or intend it to be!</span><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Why? Because your Higher Self might have a much better result in mind. But you would be preventing this nicer outcome, if you <em><strong>insist</strong></em> on the outcome you expect.) </p>
<center>
  <p>If you act in this manner, you will end up doing your life's purpose.<br>
    If you have something to give in the reality you are creating,
there <u>are</u> people ready to receive it. <br>
Whatever you are offering, there will be people receptive &amp; appreciative of that offering.</p>
</center>

  <p><a name="time" id="time"></a> </p>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p><font color="#FF00FF"><font size="+2">Trusting your Timing</font></font> </p>
  <p align="left">We, as our Higher Self (Over-Soul) actually <em>creates</em> 
    Time (as we experience it). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Higher Self exists outside 
    Time and Space.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It projects portions of itself into specific 
    time/space holograms (time/space matrixes), which we then experience as an 
    incarnation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, from the point of view of any one incarnation, 
    there is time, there is "past, present, and future". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    But from the point of view of the Higher Self, there is no Time. It's all 
    happening NOW. It's just one big Eternal-NOW. &nbsp;So keep in mind that our 
    Higher Self &nbsp;is <em>creating</em> the actual "time" that we 
    are experiencing in a linear fashion.</p>
  <p align="left">When we intensely want to do something <em><strong>now</strong></em>, 
    and it is easily possible to do it, no problem. We just do it.<br>
    But if we intensely want to do something <em><strong>now</strong></em>, and 
    it is NOT possible to do it NOW, we are then at a critical decision-junction:<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can choose to interpret this as <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    "I am not getting what I want."<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, we can choose to interpret this as 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    "I <u>always</u> get what I want. If it's not available <em><u>yet</u></em>, 
    then there <em>must</em> be an excellent reason for this."</p>
  <p align="left">Which of these choices we make is critical in determining the 
    outcome, as this choice is equivalent to selecting a <strong>BELIEF</strong>, 
    and we then experience the outcome aligned with that belief.</p>
  <p align="left">If you choose to interpret the situation as <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not getting what I want.", 
    <br>
    then, sure enough, you will <em>continue</em> to not get what you want.</p>
  <p align="left">But the alternative is this:<br>
    Choose to interpret this situation (of not being able to do what you want 
    to do NOW) as<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I <u>always</u> get what I want." 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I <u>always</u> get what I want. If it's 
    not available <em>yet</em>, there <em>must</em> be an excellent reason for 
    this."<br>
    <br>
    You see, often our Higher Self "arranges" time in such a way that 
    we do <em>not</em> get what we want when we initially want it, only because 
    it wants us to first accumulate certain experiences, certain skills, certain 
    appreciations, certain connections with other people, certain awarenesses 
    - FIRST! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that when we <em><strong>do</strong></em> get 
    to experience this thing we want, we will then be appreciating it and enjoying 
    it on a much deeper and more profound level.</p>
  <p align="left">So when you want to do something and it is not immediately available, 
    REMEMBER: Your Higher Self is merely delaying this experience, so you get 
    some other experiences first, so that you may enjoy and appreciate this thing 
    you want EVEN MORE, when you do get it.</p>
  <p align="left">So when you want to do something and it is not immediately available, 
    TRUST YOUR TIMING.<br>
    <br>
    Do not buy into the <strong>belief</strong> that <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I 
    do not get what I want."<br>
    <br>
    Instead, remind yourself:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I <u><strong>always</strong></u> get 
    what I want." <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I <u><strong>always</strong></u> 
    get what I want. If it's not available <em>yet</em>, then my Higher Self must 
    have some experiences it wishes me to have <em>first,</em> so that when I 
    <em>do</em> get 
    what I want, I'll be able to enjoy it even more. I'll be able to enjoy it 
    on a much richer, deeper basis."</p>

  <p>When we experience an undesirable reality, we have to back-track and ask 
    ourself: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    "What would I have to be believing in order 
    to create such a Reality"?</p>
  <p>Once we then get in touch with this belief that is creating the undesired 
    outcome, we can decide and choose our <u>preferred</u> belief - what belief 
    we would like to <b>REPLACE</b> this earlier belief with.</p>
  <p>So, then we adopt this new preferred-belief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah.............but 
    here's where it gets "tricky".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, 
    people find themselves "slipping back" to the old unpreferred-belief. 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Why? &nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, because they have this deep-seated sense 
    (this underlying gut feeling) that, somehow, the old belief is "more 
    real", "more solid", more "how things <i>really </i>are", 
    than the new preferred-belief.</p>
  <p>So, how we can make the new preferred belief "stick"? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    The critical factor is this: </p>
  <p>Getting used to the idea that<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font color="#400080">There 
    is no reality, except for the reality you define (according to your beliefs).</font></b><br>
    <br>
    Getting used to the idea that<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font color="#400080">There 
    is no reality, except for whatever you define your reality to be.</font></b><br>
    <br>
    Getting used to the idea that<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font color="#400080">There 
    is no "basic" reality that is any "more real" than any 
    other reality.</font></b><br>
    <br>
    Getting used to the idea that<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font color="#400080">There 
    is no "basic reality" against which you can gauge and judge how 
    "real" your new belief is.</font></b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font color="#400080"><u>The 
    reality actually is that there is no "inherent reality"</u>. &nbsp;&nbsp; 
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are only the realities 
    generated by <u>any</u> belief (all of which are equally-valid, equally-real)<br>
    </font></b><br>
    Getting used to the idea that<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font color="#400080">There 
    is no one definition of reality that is any more real or valid than any other 
    definition.</font></b></p>
  <p>Like starting a painting:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>It's an empty canvas with 
    infinite possibilities.</b><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Empty" 
    because there is NO "inherent real reality" at all!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Infinite 
    Possibilities" because reality can be ANYTHING you define it to be, according 
    to your definitions, your beliefs.</p>
  <p>When this really "sinks in". When you truly "get", "grok", 
    and understand that there is no "real" reality, you will no longer 
    have that lingering feeling that the old belief is more "real" than 
    your new preferred belief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will thereby not feel any 
    deep-seated "need" to slip back to the old belief, because it is 
    somehow more representative of "the real world".</p>
  <p>You can then easily accept and adopt whatever definitions of reality are 
    most aligned with the "you" that you prefer,<br>
    and most aligned with the "reality" you would prefer to experience.</p>
  <p>And if you find yourself, once again "slipping back" to previous 
    undesirable reality-definitions, then simply sit back and spend more time 
    contemplating these ideas about: <b><font color="#400080">&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no "basic" 
    reality that is any "more real" than any other reality.</font></b> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font color="#400080"><br>

    <font color="#400080"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All

  <p>Then in realizing that your new-preferred belief is <b>just</b> as valid, 
    and <b>just</b> as "real", as your older undesired belief, simply 
    choose to effortlessly adopt your new preferred belief.<br>

  The PRESENT is the result of the PRESENT.</font></font>
<p></p></center>

<p>Creation occurs only in the PRESENT. The PRESENT is the Now result of
what you Now believe to be most true for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;Continuity
</b>from one present moment to the next is considered "normal",
but is actually <b>optional</b>: If you suddenly make a discrete shift
in beliefs, you will experience a sudden discrete shift in your Now reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#FF00FF">The
PRESENT is the Now result of what you <u>Now</u> believe to be most true
for you.</font>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The past has absolutely <strong>no effect</strong> on the present - except to the extent that you <strong>believe</strong> it does. </p>
<p>As you change your present (by changing your present beliefs), you are "shifting" into a different parallel reality and that different parallel reality has its own "future" and "past". Said another way, when you change your present, you are likewise 
  also changing your past and your future. That is, you are shifting to a totally different 
  hologram which contains its own "past" that is consistent with its 
  "present", and also its own "future" which is likewise consistent 
  with its "present". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I believe Bashar says: "You create the past and the future from the here and now." </p>
<p>Continuity is an "illusion", just like the continuity in movies is an illusion, since it's really 24 discrete pictures per second. Therefore, continuity is optional. The past progressively <u>leads</u> to the present, but it does not <u>cause</u> the present. And just as movies can <em><strong>suddenly</strong></em> shift from one scene to a totally different scene, likewise you can too - since continuity is really not necessary. </p>
<p>Only the present is real. Therefore <strong>only the present can create the present. </strong></p>
<p>If you <strong>insist</strong> in believing that the present is the result of the past, then you are (now) dragging the past into the present, and (now) "projecting" that this seeming past has an effect on the present. (Notice, by the way, that all this "dragging the past into the present" is also all occurring ONLY in the present.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like dragging an anchor around, rather than simply letting go of the anchor (the past) and living freely and easily in the present.  <em> &nbsp;&nbsp;Be free of the past! &nbsp;&nbsp;Live joyously in the present! </em><br>

<div align="center"><font color="#FF00FF"><font size="+2">How FEAR can Serve You 
  </font></font> </div>
<p align="left">Fear means that you believe, that a scenario that you very much 
  do <u>not</u> want to happen, is very <u>likely</u> to happen!</p>
<p align="left">So fear lets you know that you are believing in a reality that 
  you do not prefer.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, fear can serve you, by being an "indicator", 
  or an "alarm", that lets you know that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey, 
  I'm believing in a reality that is not at all aligned with my Being!"</p>
<p align="left">Once you become aware of this, you can choose to change your belief, 
  so such frightening scenarios will no longer pop up in your reality.</p>
<p align="left">#1. Get&nbsp; in touch with the Belief that is causing this fear. 
  <br>
  Ask yourself: &nbsp;&nbsp;"What would I have to believe, in order to end 
  up being afraid of this right now?"</p>
<p align="left">#2. Once you get in touch with the Belief that is generating this 
  fear, then<br>
  Acknowledge that this <u>is</u> your current Believe. "Own" it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You
  can not change what you do not own.)</p>
<p align="left">#3. Ask yourself: &nbsp;&nbsp;"What Belief would I like
  to REPLACE this Belief with?"</p>
<p align="left">#4.&nbsp;Once you decide what your new preferred Belief is, accept
   it. Adopt it. Breath it in. TRUST that this new Belief is now active and functioning
   in your Being. (You don't need to "get rid of" the old Belief. You
    only need to <u>replace</u> it with your preferred Belief.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get into the <u>Mind-Set</u> of the 
  new Belief. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get into the <u>Emotional-Feeling 
  State</u> of the new Belief. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get into the <u>Body-Language</u> 
  and <u>Actions</u> of the new Belief.</p>

<p>Each Soul extends portions of itself into time &amp; space as particular incarnations. 
  Just as many fingers extend out from the same one hand, there are many incarnations 
  at many points in time and space, all emanating from the same Soul.&nbsp; From 
  the point of view of your Soul (outside time &amp; space) all these incarnations 
  (past incarnations, present incarnation, future incarnations) are all simultaneously 
  occurring NOW. Although your Soul has many incarnations, each one is a unique 
  "version" of you that in all eternity will never occur again. <font color="#FF00FF"><u>This</u> 
  incarnation of you, this version of you, will never occur again.</font> So be 
  the <u>most</u> you you can be! Be fully who you are! That is the fulfillment

<p>Abundance is the ability to do what you need to do, when you need to

<p>Unity in a society does not come from conformity. Unity can only come<b>
from granting equality and validity to the infinite diversity of <u>all</u>
the individuals.</b>&nbsp; The universe is infinitely diverse.&nbsp; Every
being has their own way of exploring the idea of infinite creation, and
all these ways are equally valid. When a society encourages the unique
expression of <u>each</u> individual, that is when the society is strongest
and most unified. </p>

<p>When you grant equality and validity to everyone, you are granting equality
and validity to all aspects of Creation, and as a reflective result of
this, the entire Creation supports <b>you</b> in everything you do as well!

  <p align="left">Existence is Eternal - without beginning. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left">Therefore Existence existed <strong>BEFORE</strong> the concept of "purpose" or "meaning" came into being. <br>
    Therefore, Existence does not <em>need</em> to have any particular "purpose" or "meaning" to justify its existence. It simply <em>is</em>.<br>
    <br>
    In other words, the Infinite Creator set it all up as a blank slate (<em>tabula rasa</em>), so that YOU can superimpose absolutely ANY &nbsp;"meaning" or "purpose" that you wish.<br>
    <br>
    So, to be technically accurate, the universe is "meaningless".<br>
    <br>
    But this is a good thing!&nbsp;&nbsp;   It is truly a blessing! <br>
    The Infinite Creator has given YOU free will, so that you can now use your free will, to superimpose absolutely <strong>ANY</strong> &nbsp;<strong><em>"meaning" of life</em></strong>, or <strong><em>"purpose" of existence</em></strong> that you wish! </p>

<p></p></center>

<p><font color="#FF00FF"><b>Judgment</b> is invalidating that which you
do not prefer. </font>Whenever you <b>judge </b>anything, by focusing your
attention on it, you exchange energies with it, and so you "become"
that vibration. So you automatically become the very thing you disapprove
of.&nbsp;&nbsp; You become that which you invalidate.&nbsp; <b>Preference</b>,
on the other hand, is not judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF00FF"><b>Preference</b>
is exercising your ability to discern what is really "you", </font>what
excites you, and then making choices aligned with the real "you".
&nbsp;To prefer one thing does not necessitate invalidating those other
things you do not prefer.</p>
<p>So the recommendation is: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" class="style1"><strong>Select what you prefer, <em><br>
WITHOUT</em> judging (invalidating) what you do NOT prefer. </strong></p>
<p>You become whatever you focus your attention on.&nbsp;&nbsp; To assign
any meaning to anything - either a positive meaning or a negative meaning
- is to invite that into your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being neutral about
something - assigning it no meaning - is the way to <u>not</u> attract
that reality into your life. </p>

<center><table>

</tbody></table></center>

<p><b>Cease to invalidate yourself</b>, because you are all you have to
work with in your universe. You are the representation, in your own way,
of the Infinite. If you invalidate that, or any part of that, then you
do not allow yourself to function as a whole being capable of using information
coming to you from others in a constructive way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you invalidate yourself, you are seriously handicapping your only reality-creation-engine.</p>

<p align="left">When you are dreaming, the dream seems to be "<span class="style21">totally REAL!</span>". Yet when you wake up, you realize that it was "<span class="style21">only a dream</span>".<br>
  <br>
  Right NOW, you are actually in Spirit. You are not in any physical dimension.  You have never left Spirit.<br>
  Right NOW, you are in Spirit - <em><strong>dreaming</strong></em> that you are having this physical incarnation. <br>
  <br>
  Right NOW, this dream of having a physical incarnation seems "<span class="style21">totally REAL!</span>".</p>
<p align="left">Yet, when you go through the "death" transition, you WAKE UP from this dream, and "remember" that you are actually Spirit.<br>
  And you realize, that this entire physcal incarnation experience was "<span class="style21">only a dream</span>".
</p>
<p align="left"><span class="style57">SIDE NOTE: </span></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Just because it is "just a dream", does not mean it is not "real". <br>
    When your consciousness is focused <em><strong>within </strong></em>any TIME-SPACE-HOLOGRAM, it is "real".<br>
  When your consciousness is focused <em><strong>outside of </strong></em>any TIME-SPACE-HOLOGRAM, that then seems to be an "illusion".<br>
  Well, which is true?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Real"&nbsp; or&nbsp; "Illusion"&nbsp;?<br>
  They are <strong>BOTH </strong>correct and true!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It simple depends on your point of view (where your consciousness is focused - at any moment). <br> 
  <br>
  And............when you pass through  the "death transition" and "wake up" from  this dream, you are STILL dreaming:   &nbsp;but you are now  in a higher-dimensional dream.<br>
  Both are equally "real". Both are equally a "dream". <br>
  And as you Ascend into higher and higher dimensions, you repeatedly "wake up" from that dream, into a more <em>awake</em> reality, but that is also a dream, <br>
  which you will realize when you ascend into an even higher dimension.<br>
  <br>
  Thoughts are the only reality.<br>
  Dreams are the only reality.<br>
  Consciousness is the only reality.

<p align="center" class="style14">There is only ONE MOMENT in all creation - the eternal NOW. </p>
<p align="center" class="style14">"Time" is an illusion created by consciousness. </p>
<p class="style13">This analogy will clarify:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style13">In a film projector, the individual frames of the film are shown in a rapid steady sequence - one frame at a time.&nbsp;&nbsp; This rapid steady sequence of STILL frames creates the ILLUSION of flowing time. But in truth, all the actual frames that are used all exist simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the illusion of "time" only when the film projector displays those frames - one frame at a time - in a rapid steady sequence. Yet, ALL those frames exist simultaneously. In fact the projectionist can take out the roll of film, spread it out on the floor and view all those frames at the same time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style13">In a similar manner, our consciousness "projects" individual "still frames of reality" in a steady and extremely rapid sequence. Bashar says we do this BILLIONS of times per second - thus creating the ILLUSION of the steady flow of TIME. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of these individual "still frames of reality" contains absolutely NO MOTION whatsoever! It is a frozen snapshot - perfectly still.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, by sequencing these still frames at a steady very-fast rate, we have the ILLUSION of time - the flow of time. <br>
  (NOTE:   The actutal "flash-rate" or "frame-rate" for the physical dimension that we are experiencing is an extremely tiny increment of time, defined by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant" target="_blank">Plank's constant</a></strong>.) </p>
<p class="style13">Our earthly consciousness functions like the film projec<span class="style17">tor</span>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which views these still frames <em>only </em>in a rapid steady sequence.<br>
Our Higher Self &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;functions like the film projection<span class="style17">ist</span>, &nbsp;who can take out the roll of film and view ALL the frames simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Higher Self functions in a timeless eternal-NOW zone. </p>
<p class="style13">Therefore, all time is truly NOW. Your past lives are occurring right NOW. Your future lives are occurring right NOW. All time periods are co-existing right NOW. &nbsp;The concept of "reincarnation" is not quite as accurate as "simultaneous multiple incarnations". </p>
<p class="style13">Normally, the "reality-frames" that we view in rapid sequence are related and similar. Hence the ILLUSION of continuity. </p>
<p align="center" class="style14">Continuity is an ILLUSION.</p>
<p class="style13">Continuity is an ILLUSION since one is not obligated to go from one frame to another frame that is almost the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;(The "normal" flow of time.)&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is possible to "hop" to a totally-different frame in this infinite universe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this would be what is normally referred to as "<strong>Time Travel"</strong>. </p>
<p align="center" class="style14">There is no paradox in <strong>Time Travel</strong>.</p>
<p class="style13">There is no paradox in <strong>Time Travel</strong>. The classic "grandfather paradox" of time-travel is not really a paradox at all. This classic paradox basically states:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style13">If you time-travel to the time of your grand-father and kill him before he has any children, then your father could not have been born. Then you also could not have been born. So, if you were never born, how could you go back in time to kill your grand-father? </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style13">SOLUTION: There are an infinite number of time-lines - all simultaneously co-existing. &nbsp;(parallel but distinct time-tracks, or "flows", of time events) &nbsp;&nbsp;Every time you "Time Travel" in the classic sense, to the past or future, you are hopping over to a DIFFERENT time-line, not the one that you have been living in. &nbsp;&nbsp;So anything you do in <em>THAT</em> time-line is part of the "natural history" of <em>THAT</em> time-line, but there was no change whatsoever in your originating time-line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This DIFFERENT time-line may <em>appear</em> to be practically identical to your own past or future, but it is in fact a totally DIFFERENT time-line. &nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, no paradox.</p>

<p>Our perceived "external reality" is actually an illusion (a holographic illusion) that is reflelcting (like a mirror) back to us our  Beliefs, Thoughts, &amp; Feelings.<br>

(A mirror does not have a mind of its own. It can <strong><em>only</em></strong> reflect back whatever is in front of it - whatever are your Beliefs, Thoughts, &amp; Feeling.)</p>

<hr>
<p align="center"><span class="style9 style21"><a name="Visualization" id="Visualization"></a>Visualization</span></p>
<p align="left">The <em>recommended</em> way to use <strong>Visualization</strong>, to get some preferred reality, is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">1. Visualize the preferred reality within your Visualization intently.<br>
    2. This gets you into an EXCITED STATE &nbsp;&nbsp;(from imagining you already have it).<br>
    3. Then totally DROP that visaulization and absolutely do not insist that it manifest in that particular form.
    <br>
    4. Your Higher Self then tunes into your EXCITED STATE and your desire, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    and then begins working on getting for you a WAY BETTER outcome than anything you could have ever imagined. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">NOTE: <br>
By <em>hanging on</em> to your Visualization and <em>insisting</em> that the outcome be in that form, you are LIMITING the optimum outcome, and preventing your Higher Self from bringing you an outcome that is FAR SUPERIOR to anything that you could have ever imagined or thought of. &nbsp;And it can bring it to you in an <strong>easier</strong> and<strong> faster </strong>way, than the particular outcome you were insisting on. </p>
