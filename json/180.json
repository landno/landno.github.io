<span data-sentence-id=\"180#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The happy learner cannot feel guilty about learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is so essential to learning that it should never be forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The guiltless learner learns easily because his thoughts are free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet this entails the recognition that guilt is interference, not salvation, and serves no useful function at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps you are accustomed to using guiltlessness merely to offset the pain of guilt, and do not look upon it as having value in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You believe that guilt and guiltlessness are both of value, each representing an escape from what the other does not offer you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not want either alone, for without both you do not see yourself as whole and therefore happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you are whole only in your guiltlessness, and only in your guiltlessness can you be happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no conflict here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To wish for guilt in any way, in any form, will lose appreciation of the value of your guiltlessness, and push it from your sight.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no compromise that you can make with guilt, and escape the pain that only guiltlessness allays.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Learning is living here, as creating is being in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whenever the pain of guilt seems to attract you, remember that if you yield to it, you are deciding against your happiness, and will not learn how to be happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Say therefore, to yourself, gently, but with the conviction born of the Love of God and of His Son:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"180#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What I experience I will make manifest.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If I am guiltless, I have nothing to fear.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I choose to testify to my acceptance of the Atonement, not to its rejection.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I would accept my guiltlessness by making it manifest and sharing it.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let me bring peace to God’s Son from his Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Each day, each hour and minute, even each second, you are deciding between the crucifixion and the resurrection; between the ego and the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego is the choice for guilt; the Holy Spirit the choice for guiltlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The power of decision is all that is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you can decide between is fixed, because there are no alternatives except truth and illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And there is no overlap between them, because they are opposites which cannot be reconciled and cannot both be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are guilty or guiltless, bound or free, unhappy or happy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle teaches you that you have chosen guiltlessness, freedom and joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not a cause, but an effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the natural result of choosing right, attesting to your happiness that comes from choosing to be free of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everyone you offer healing to returns it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everyone you attack keeps it and cherishes it by holding it against you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Whether he does this or does it not will make no difference; you will think he does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is impossible to offer what you do not want without this penalty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The cost of giving <i>is</i> receiving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Either it is a penalty from which you suffer, or the happy purchase of a treasure to hold dear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No penalty is ever asked of God’s Son except by himself and of himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every chance given him to heal is another opportunity to replace darkness with light and fear with love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If he refuses it he binds himself to darkness, because he did not choose to free his brother and enter light with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By giving power to nothing, he throws away the joyous opportunity to learn that nothing has no power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And by not dispelling darkness, he became afraid of darkness and of light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The joy of learning that darkness has no power over the Son of God is the happy lesson the Holy Spirit teaches, and would have you teach with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is His joy to teach it, as it will be yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The way to teach this simple lesson is merely this: Guiltlessness is invulnerability.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore, make your invulnerability manifest to everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Teach him that, whatever he may try to do to you, your perfect freedom from the belief that you can be harmed shows him that he is guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He can do nothing that can hurt you, and by refusing to allow him to think he can, you teach him that the Atonement, which you have accepted for yourself, is also his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is nothing to forgive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No one can hurt the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His guilt is wholly without cause, and being without cause, cannot exist.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God is the only Cause, and guilt is not of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Teach no one he has hurt you, for if you do, you teach yourself that what is not of God has power over you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span><i>The causeless cannot be.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not attest to it, and do not foster belief in it in any mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember always that mind is one, and cause is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will learn communication with this oneness only when you learn to deny the causeless, and accept the Cause of God as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The power that God has given to His Son <i>is</i> his, and nothing else can His Son see or choose to look upon without imposing on himself the penalty of guilt, in place of all the happy teaching the Holy Spirit would gladly offer him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you choose to make decisions for yourself you are thinking destructively, and the decision will be wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It will hurt you because of the concept of decision that led to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not true that you can make decisions by yourself or for yourself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No thought of God’s Son can be separate or isolated in its effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Every decision is made for the whole Sonship, directed in and out, and influencing a constellation larger than anything you ever dreamed of.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those who accept the Atonement <i>are</i> invulnerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But those who believe they are guilty will respond to guilt, because they think it is salvation, and will not refuse to see it and side with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They believe that increasing guilt is self-protection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And they will fail to understand the simple fact that what they do not want must hurt them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All this arises because they do not believe that what they want is good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet will was given them because it is holy, and will bring to them all that they need, coming as naturally as peace that knows no limits.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is nothing their will fails to provide that offers them anything of value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet because they do not understand their will, the Holy Spirit quietly understands it for them, and gives them what they want without effort, strain, or the impossible burden of deciding what they want and need alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#11:1\"><span class=\"snr

the answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you be content with little, which is all that you alone can offer yourself, when He Who gives you everything will simply offer it to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He will never ask what you have done to make you worthy of the gift of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Ask it not therefore of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Instead, accept His answer, for He knows that you are worthy of everything God wills for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not try to escape the gift of God He so freely and so gladly offers you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He offers you but what God gave Him for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You need not decide whether or not you are deserving of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God knows you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"180#12\"><p

of yourself in place of His calm and unswerving value of His Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothing can shake God’s conviction of the perfect purity of everything that He created, for it <i>is</i> wholly pure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not decide against it, for being of Him it must be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Peace abides in every mind that quietly accepts the plan God set for its Atonement, relinquishing its own.</span> <span

no other “enemy,” and against this strange distortion of the purity of the Son of God the Holy Spirit is your only Friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is the strong protector of the innocence that sets you free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it is His decision to undo everything that would obscure your

gladly on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>With Him you will not fail to learn that what God wills for you <i>is</i> your will.</span> <span

appraise the worth of God’s Son whom He created holy, for to do so is to evaluate his Father and judge against Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you <i>will</i> feel guilty for this imagined crime, which no one in this world or Heaven could possibly commit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit teaches only that the “sin” of self-replacement on the throne of God is not a source of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What cannot happen can have no

of God, Who has remembered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"180#15:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For it is quite impossible that He could ever let His Son drop from the loving Mind wherein he
