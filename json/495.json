class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is important to remember that miracles and vision necessarily go together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This needs repeating, and frequent repeating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a central idea in your new thought system, and the perception that it produces.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle is always there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its presence is not caused by your vision; its absence is not the result of your failure to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is only your awareness of miracles that is affected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You will see them in the light; you will not see them in the dark.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To you, then, light is crucial.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>While you remain in darkness, the miracle remains unseen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus you are convinced it is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This follows from the premises from which the darkness comes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Denial of light leads to failure to perceive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Failure to perceive light is to perceive darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The light is useless to you then, even though it is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You cannot use it because its presence is unknown to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And the seeming reality of the darkness makes the idea of light meaningless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To be told that what you do not see is there sounds like insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is very difficult to become convinced that it is insanity not to see what is there, and to see what is not there instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not doubt that the body’s eyes can see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do not doubt the images they show you are reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your faith lies in the darkness, not the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How can this be reversed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For you it is impossible, but you are not alone in this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your efforts, however little they may be, have strong support.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Did you but realize how great this strength, your doubts would vanish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Today we will devote ourselves to the attempt to let you feel this strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you have felt the strength in you, which makes all miracles within your easy reach, you will not doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The miracles your sense of weakness hides will leap into awareness as you feel the strength in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Three times today, set aside about ten minutes for a quiet time in which you try to leave your weakness behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is accomplished very simply, as you instruct yourself that you are not a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Faith goes to what you want, and you instruct your mind accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your will remains your teacher, and your will has all the strength to do what it desires.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can escape the body if you choose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can experience the strength in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin the longer practice periods with this statement of true cause and effect relationships:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Miracles are seen in light.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body’s eyes do not perceive the light.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But I am not a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What am I?</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The question with which this statement ends is needed for our exercises today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What you think you are is a belief to be undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But what you really are must be revealed to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The belief you are a body calls for correction, being a mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The truth of what you are calls on the strength in you to bring to your awareness what the mistake conceals.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are not a body, what are you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You need to be aware of what the Holy Spirit uses to replace the image of a body in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You need to feel something to put your faith in, as you lift it from the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You need a real experience of something else, something more solid and more sure; more worthy of your faith, and really there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are not a body, what are you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Ask this in honesty, and then devote several minutes to allowing your mistaken thoughts about your attributes to be corrected, and their opposites to take their place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Say, for example:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am not weak, but strong.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I am not helpless, but all powerful.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I am not limited, but unlimited.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I am not doubtful, but certain.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I am not an illusion, but a reality.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I cannot see in darkness, but in light.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the second phase of the exercise period, try to experience these truths about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Concentrate particularly on the experience of strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember that all sense of weakness is associated with the belief you are a body, a belief that is mistaken and deserves no faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Try to remove your faith from it, if only for a moment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will be accustomed to keeping faith with the more worthy in you as we go along.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Relax for the rest of the practice period, confident that your efforts, however meager, are fully supported by the strength of God and all His Thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is from Them that your strength will come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is through Their strong support that you will feel the strength in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are united with you in this practice period, in which you share a purpose like Their Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Theirs is the light in which you will see miracles, because Their strength is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Their strength becomes your eyes, that you may see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Five or six times an hour, at reasonably regular intervals, remind yourself that miracles are seen in light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Also, be sure to meet temptation with today’s idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This form would be helpful for this special purpose:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"495#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Miracles are seen in light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let me not close my eyes because of this.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is important to remember that miracles and vision necessarily go together.
