data-sentence-id=\"337#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will attack what does not satisfy, and thus you will not see you made it up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You always fight illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the truth behind them is so lovely and so still in loving gentleness, were you aware of it you would forget defensiveness entirely, and rush to its embrace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The truth could never be attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this you knew when you made idols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They were made that this might be forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You attack but false ideas, and never truthful ones.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All idols are the false ideas you made to fill the gap you think arose between yourself and what is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And you attack them for the things you think they represent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What lies beyond them cannot be attacked.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"337#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The wearying, dissatisfying gods you made are blown-up children’s toys.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A child is frightened when a wooden head springs up as a closed box is opened suddenly, or when a soft and silent woolly bear begins to squeak as he takes hold of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The rules he made for boxes and for bears have failed him, and have broken his “control” of what surrounds him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And he is afraid, because he thought the rules protected him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now must he learn the boxes and the bears did not deceive him, broke no rules, nor mean his world is made chaotic and unsafe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He was mistaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He misunderstood what made him safe, and thought that it had left.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"337#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The gap that is not there is filled with toys in countless forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And each one seems to break the rules you set for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It never was the thing you thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It must appear to break your rules for safety, since the rules were wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But <i>you</i> are not endangered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can laugh at popping heads and squeaking toys, as does the child who learns they are no threat to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet while he likes to play with them, he still perceives them as obeying rules he made for his enjoyment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>So there still are rules that they can seem to break and frighten him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet <i>is</i> he at the mercy of his toys?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And <i>can</i> they represent a threat to him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"337#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Reality observes the laws of God, and not the rules you set.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is His laws that guarantee your safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All illusions that you believe about yourself obey no laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They seem to dance a little while, according to the rules you set for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But then they fall and cannot rise again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They are but toys, my child, so do not grieve for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Their dancing never brought you joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But neither were they things to frighten you, nor make you safe if they obeyed your rules.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>They must be neither cherished nor attacked, but merely looked upon as children’s toys without a single meaning of their own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>See one in them and you will see them all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>See none in them and they will touch you not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"337#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Appearances deceive <i>because</i> they are appearances and not reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Dwell not on them in any form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They but obscure reality, and they bring fear <i>because</i> they hide the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not attack what you have made to let you be deceived, for thus you prove that you have been deceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Attack has power to make illusions real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet what it makes is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who could be made fearful by a power that can have no real effects at all?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What could it be but an illusion, making things appear like to itself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Look calmly at its toys, and understand that they are idols which but dance to vain desires.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Give them not your worship, for they are not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet this is equally forgotten in attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>God’s Son needs no defense against his dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>His idols do not threaten him at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>His one mistake is that he thinks them real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#5:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>What can the power of illusions do?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"337#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Appearances can but deceive the mind that wants to be deceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you can make a simple choice that will forever place you far beyond deception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You need not concern yourself with how this will be done, for this you cannot understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But you will understand that mighty changes have been quickly brought about, when you decide one very simple thing; you do not want whatever you believe an idol gives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For thus the Son of God declares that he is free of idols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And thus <i>is</i> he free.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"337#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation is a paradox indeed!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What could it be except a happy dream?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It asks you but that you forgive all things that no one ever did; to overlook what is not there, and not to look upon the unreal as reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are but asked to let your will be done, and seek no longer for the things you do not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you are asked to let yourself be free of all the dreams of what you never were, and seek no more to substitute the strength of idle wishes for the Will of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"337#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here does the dream of separation start to fade and disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For here the gap that is not there begins to be perceived without the toys of terror that you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No more than this is asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Be glad indeed salvation asks so little, not so much.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It asks for nothing in reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And even in illusions it but asks forgiveness be the substitute for fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Such is the only rule for happy dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The gap is emptied of the toys of fear, and then its unreality is plain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Dreams are for nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And the Son of God can have no need of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>They offer him no single thing that he could ever want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>He is delivered from illusions by his will, and but restored to what he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"337#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>What could God’s plan for his salvation be, except a means to give him to Himself?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You will attack
