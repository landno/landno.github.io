Spirit","inlineNumber":"V."},"annotation":"T-1.V","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-1-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"057#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle is much like the body in that both are learning aids for facilitating a state in which they become unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When spirit’s original state of direct communication is reached, neither the body nor the miracle serves any purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>While you believe you are in a body, however, you can choose between loveless and miraculous channels of expression.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can make an empty shell, but you cannot express nothing at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can wait, delay, paralyze yourself, or reduce your creativity almost to nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But you cannot abolish it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You can destroy your medium of communication, but not your potential.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You did not create yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"057#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The basic decision of the miracle-minded is not to wait on time any longer than is necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Time can waste as well as be wasted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The miracle worker, therefore, accepts the time-control factor gladly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He recognizes that every collapse of time brings everyone closer to the ultimate release from time, in which the Son and the Father are One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Equality does not imply equality <i>now</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When everyone recognizes that he has everything, individual contributions to the Sonship will no longer be necessary.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"057#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When the Atonement has been completed, all talents will be shared by all the Sons of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God is not partial.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All His children have His total Love, and all His gifts are freely given to everyone alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>“Except ye become as little children” means that unless you fully recognize your complete dependence on God, you cannot know the real power of the Son in his true relationship with the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The specialness of God’s Sons does not stem from exclusion but from inclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All my brothers are special.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If they believe they are deprived of anything, their perception becomes distorted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>When this occurs the whole family of God, or the Sonship, is impaired in its relationships.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"057#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Ultimately, every member of the family of God must return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The miracle calls him to return because it blesses and honors him, even though he may be absent in spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>“God is not mocked” is not a warning but a reassurance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God <i>would</i> be mocked if any of His creations lacked holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The creation is whole, and the mark of wholeness is holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Miracles are affirmations of Sonship, which is a state of completion and abundance.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"057#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whatever is true is eternal, and cannot change or be changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Spirit is therefore unalterable because it is already perfect, but the mind can elect what it chooses to serve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The only limit put on its choice is that it cannot serve two masters.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If it elects to do so, the mind can become the medium by which spirit creates along the line of its own creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If it does not freely elect to do so, it retains its creative potential but places itself under tyrannous rather than Authoritative control.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As a result it imprisons, because such are the dictates of tyrants.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To change your mind means to place it at the disposal of <i>true</i> Authority.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"057#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle is a sign that the mind has chosen to be led by me in Christ’s service.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The abundance of Christ is the natural result of choosing to follow Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All shallow roots must be uprooted, because they are not deep enough to sustain you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The illusion that shallow roots can be deepened, and thus made to hold, is one of the distortions on which the reverse of the Golden Rule rests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As these false underpinnings are given up, the equilibrium is temporarily experienced as unstable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>However, nothing is less stable than an upside-down orientation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"057#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor can anything that holds it upside down be conducive to increased stability.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The miracle is much like the body in that both are learning aids for facilitating a state
