<span data-sentence-id=\"194#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant is the Holy Spirit’s most useful learning device for teaching you love’s meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For its purpose is to suspend judgment entirely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Judgment always rests on the past, for past experience is the basis on which you judge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Judgment becomes impossible without the past, for without it you do not understand anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You would make no attempt to judge, because it would be quite apparent to you that you do not understand what anything means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are afraid of this because you believe that without the ego, all would be chaos.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet I assure you that without the ego, all would be love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The past is the ego’s chief learning device, for it is in the past that you learned to define your own needs and acquired methods for meeting them on your own terms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We have said that to limit love to part of the Sonship is to bring guilt into your relationships, and thus make them unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you seek to separate out certain aspects of the totality and look to them to meet your imagined needs, you are attempting to use separation to save you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How, then, could guilt not enter?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For separation is the source of guilt, and to appeal to it for salvation is to believe you are alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To be alone <i>is</i> to be guilty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For to experience yourself as alone is to deny the Oneness of the Father and His Son, and thus to attack reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot love parts of reality and understand what love means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you would love unlike to God, Who knows no special love, how can you understand it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To believe that <i>special</i> relationships, with <i>special</i> love, can offer you salvation is the belief that separation is salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For it is the complete equality of the Atonement in which salvation lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How can you decide that special aspects of the Sonship can give you more than others?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The past has taught you this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet the holy instant teaches you it is not so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Because of guilt, all special relationships have elements of fear in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is why they shift and change so frequently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are not based on changeless love alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And love, where fear has entered, cannot be depended on because it is not perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In His function as Interpreter of what you made, the Holy Spirit uses special relationships, which you have chosen to support the ego, as learning experiences that point to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Under His teaching, every relationship becomes a lesson in love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit knows no one is special.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet He also perceives that you have made special relationships, which He would purify and not let you destroy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>However unholy the reason you made them may be, He can translate them into holiness by removing as much fear as you will let Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can place any relationship under His care and be sure that it will not result in pain, if you offer Him your willingness to have it serve no need but His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All the guilt in it arises from your use of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All the love from His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not, then, be afraid to let go your imagined needs, which would destroy the relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your only need is His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Any relationship you would substitute for another has not been offered to the Holy Spirit for His use.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There <i>is</i> no substitute for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you would attempt to substitute one aspect of love for another, you have placed less value on one and more on the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have not only separated them, but you have also judged against both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you had judged against yourself first, or you would never have imagined that you needed your brothers as they were not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Unless you had seen yourself as without love, you could not have judged them so like you in lack.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s use of relationships is so fragmented that it frequently goes even farther; one part of one aspect suits its purposes, while it prefers different parts of another aspect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Thus does it assemble reality to its own capricious liking, offering for your seeking a picture whose likeness does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For there is nothing in Heaven or earth that it resembles, and so, however much you seek for its reality, you cannot find it because it is not real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone on earth has formed special relationships, and although this is not so in Heaven, the Holy Spirit knows how to bring a touch of Heaven to them here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the holy instant no one is special, for your personal needs intrude on no one to make your brothers seem different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Without the values from the past, you would see them all the same and like yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor would you see any separation between yourself and them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In the holy instant, you see in each relationship what it will be when you perceive only the present.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God knows you <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He remembers nothing, having always known you exactly as He knows you now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The holy instant reflects His knowing by bringing all perception out of the past, thus removing the frame of reference you have built by which to judge your brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Once this is gone, the Holy Spirit substitutes His frame of reference for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His frame of reference is simply God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit’s timelessness lies only here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For in the holy instant, free of the past, you see that love is in you, and you have no need to look without and snatch love guiltily from where you thought it was.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All your relationships are blessed in the holy instant, because the blessing is not limited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the holy instant the Sonship gains as one, and united in your blessing it becomes one to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The meaning of love is the meaning God gave to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Give to it any meaning apart from His, and it is impossible to understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God loves every brother as He loves you; neither less nor more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He needs them all equally, and so do you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In time, you have been told to offer miracles as I direct, and let the Holy Spirit bring to you those who are seeking you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet in the holy instant you unite directly with God, and all your brothers join in Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Those who are joined in Christ are in no way separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For Christ is the Self the Sonship shares, as God shares His Self with Christ.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"194#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think you that you can judge the Self of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God has created It beyond judgment, out of His need to extend His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>With love in you, you have no need except to extend it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the holy instant there is no conflict of needs, for there is only one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the holy instant reaches to eternity, and to the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"194#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And it is only there love has meaning, and only there can it be understood.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The holy instant is the Holy Spirit’s most useful learning device for teaching you love’s meaning.
