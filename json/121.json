class=\"snr\">2</span>Ask and it shall be given you, because it has already <i>been</i> given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Ask for light and learn that you <i>are</i> light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you want understanding and enlightenment you will learn it, because your decision to learn it is the decision to listen to the Teacher Who knows of light, and can therefore teach it to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no limit on your learning because there is no limit on your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no limit on His teaching because He was created to teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Understanding His function perfectly He fulfills it perfectly, because that is His joy and yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"121#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To fulfill the Will of God perfectly is the only joy and peace that can be fully known, because it is the only function that can be fully experienced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When this is accomplished, then, there is no other experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet the wish for other experience will block its accomplishment, because God’s Will cannot be forced upon you, being an experience of total willingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit understands how to teach this, but you do not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is why you need Him, and why God gave Him to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only His teaching will release your will to God’s, uniting it with His power and glory and establishing them as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You share them as God shares them, because this is the natural outcome of their being.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"121#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Will of the Father and of the Son are One, by Their extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Their extension is the result of Their Oneness, holding Their unity together by extending Their joint Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is perfect creation by the perfectly created, in union with the perfect Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Father must give fatherhood to His Son, because His Own Fatherhood must be extended outward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You who belong in God have the holy function of extending His Fatherhood by placing no limits upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let the Holy Spirit teach you how to do this, for you can know what it means only of God Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"121#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you meet anyone, remember it is a holy encounter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As you see him you will see yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As you treat him you will treat yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As you think of him you will think of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Never forget this, for in him you will find yourself or lose yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Whenever two Sons of God meet, they are given another chance at salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not leave anyone without giving salvation to him and receiving it yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For I am always there with you, in remembrance of <i>you.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"121#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The goal of the curriculum, regardless of the teacher you choose, is “Know thyself.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is nothing else to seek.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Everyone is looking for himself and for the power and glory he thinks he has lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whenever you are with anyone, you have another opportunity to find them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your power and glory are in him because they are yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego tries to find them in yourself alone, because it does not know where to look.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Holy Spirit teaches you that if you look only at yourself you cannot find yourself, because that is not what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Whenever you are with a brother, you are learning what you are because you are teaching what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He will respond either with pain or with joy, depending on which teacher you are following.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He will be imprisoned or released according to your decision, and so will you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Never forget your responsibility to him, because it is your responsibility to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Give him his place in the Kingdom and you will have yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"121#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Kingdom cannot be found alone, and you who are the Kingdom cannot find yourself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To achieve the goal of the curriculum, then, you cannot listen to the ego, whose purpose is to defeat its own goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego does not know this, because it does not know anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But you can know it, and you will know it if you are willing to look at what the ego would make of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is your responsibility, because once you have really looked at it you <i>will</i> accept the Atonement for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What other choice could you make?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Having made this choice you will understand why you once believed that, when you met someone else, you thought he <i>was</i> someone else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And every holy encounter in which you enter fully will teach you this is not so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"121#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can encounter only part of yourself because you are part of God, Who is everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His power and glory are everywhere, and you cannot be excluded from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego teaches that your strength is in you alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit teaches that all strength is in God and <i>therefore</i> in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God wills no one suffer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He does not will anyone to suffer for a wrong decision, including you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is why He has given you the means for undoing it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Through His power and glory all your wrong decisions are undone completely, releasing you and your brother from every imprisoning thought any part of the Sonship holds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Wrong decisions have no power, because they are not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The imprisonment they seem to produce is no more true than they are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"121#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Power and glory belong to God alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So do you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God gives whatever belongs to Him because He gives of Himself, and everything belongs to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Giving of yourself is the function He gave you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Fulfilling it perfectly will let you remember what you <i>have</i> of Him, and by this you will remember also what you <i>are</i> in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot be powerless to do this, because this is your power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Glory is God’s gift to you, because that is what He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"121#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>See this glory everywhere to remember what you are.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Glory to God in the highest, and to you because He has so willed it.
