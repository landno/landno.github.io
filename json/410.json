preoccupation with the past is the cause of the misconception about time from which your seeing suffers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your mind cannot grasp the present, which is the only time there is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It therefore cannot understand time, and cannot, in fact, understand anything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"410#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The one wholly true thought one can hold about the past is that it is not here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To think about it at all is therefore to think about illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Very few have realized what is actually entailed in picturing the past or in anticipating the future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The mind is actually blank when it does this, because it is not really thinking about anything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"410#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The purpose of the exercises for today is to begin to train your mind to recognize when it is not really thinking at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>While thoughtless ideas preoccupy your mind, the truth is blocked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Recognizing that your mind has been merely blank, rather than believing that it is filled with real ideas, is the first step to opening the way to vision.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"410#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The exercises for today should be done with eyes closed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is because you actually cannot see anything, and it is easier to recognize that no matter how vividly you may picture a thought, you are not seeing anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>With as little investment as possible, search your mind for the usual minute or so, merely noting the thoughts you find there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Name each one by the central figure or theme it contains, and pass on to the next.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Introduce the practice period by saying:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"410#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I seem to be thinking about _________.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"410#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Then name each of your thoughts specifically, for example:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"410#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I seem to be thinking about [name of a person], about [name of an object], about [name of an emotion],</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"410#5:2\">and so on, concluding at the end of the mind-searching period with:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"410#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But my mind is preoccupied with past thoughts.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"410#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This can be done four or five times during the day, unless you find it irritates you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you find it trying, three or four times is sufficient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"410#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You might find it helpful, however, to include your irritation, or any emotion that the idea for today may induce, in the mind searching itself.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"This idea is, of course, the reason why you see only the past.
