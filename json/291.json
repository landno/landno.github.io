<span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet if the Holy Spirit can commute each sentence that you laid upon yourself into a blessing, then it cannot be a sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Sin is the only thing in all the world that cannot change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is immutable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And on its changelessness the world depends.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The magic of the world can seem to hide the pain of sin from sinners, and deceive with glitter and with guile.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet each one knows the cost of sin is death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For sin is a request for death, a wish to make this world’s foundation sure as love, dependable as Heaven, and as strong as God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The world is safe from love to everyone who thinks sin possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Nor will it change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet is it possible what God created not should share the attributes of His creation, when it opposes it in every way?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It cannot be the “sinner’s” wish for death is just as strong as is God’s Will for life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor can the basis of a world He did not make be firm and sure as Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How could it be that hell and Heaven are the same?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And is it possible that what He did not will cannot be changed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is immutable besides His Will?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what can share its attributes except itself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What wish can rise against His Will, and be immutable?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you could realize nothing is changeless but the Will of God, this course would not be difficult for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For it is this that you do not believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet there is nothing else you could believe, if you but looked at what it really is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us go back to what we said before, and think of it more carefully.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It must be so that either God is mad, or is this world a place of madness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Not one Thought of His makes any sense at all within this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And nothing that the world believes as true has any meaning in His Mind at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What makes no sense and has no meaning is insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what is madness cannot be the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If one belief so deeply valued here were true, then every Thought God ever had is an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And if but one Thought of His is true, then all beliefs the world gives any meaning to are false, and make no sense at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is the choice you make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Do not attempt to see it differently, nor twist it into something it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>For only this decision can you make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The rest is up to God, and not to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To justify one value that the world upholds is to deny your Father’s sanity and yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For God and His beloved Son do not think differently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And it is the agreement of Their thought that makes the Son a co-creator with the Mind Whose Thought created him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>So if he chooses to believe one thought opposed to truth, he has decided he is not his Father’s Son because the Son is mad, and sanity must lie apart from both the Father and the Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This you believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Think not that this belief depends upon the form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who thinks the world is sane in any way, is justified in anything it thinks, or is maintained by any form of reason, believes this to be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Sin is not real <i>because</i> the Father and the Son are not insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This world is meaningless <i>because</i> it rests on sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Who could create the changeless if it does not rest on truth?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit has the power to change the whole foundation of the world you see to something else; a basis not insane, on which a sane perception can be based, another world perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And one in which nothing is contradicted that would lead the Son of God to sanity and joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing attests to death and cruelty; to separation and to differences.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For here is everything perceived as one, and no one loses that each one may gain.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Test everything that you believe against this one requirement, and understand that everything that meets this one demand is worthy of your faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What is not love is sin, and either one perceives the other as insane and meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Love is the basis for a world perceived as wholly mad to sinners, who believe theirs is the way to sanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But sin is equally insane within the sight of love, whose gentle eyes would look beyond the madness and rest peacefully on truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Each sees a world immutable, as each defines the changeless and eternal truth of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And each reflects a view of what the Father and the Son must be, to make that viewpoint meaningful and sane.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your special function is the special form in which the fact that God is not insane appears most sensible and meaningful to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The content is the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The form is suited to your special needs, and to the special time and place in which you think you find yourself, and where you can be free of place and time, and all that you believe must limit you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Son of God cannot be bound by time nor place nor anything God did not will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet if His Will is seen as madness, then the form of sanity which makes it most acceptable to those who are insane requires special choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nor can this choice be made by the insane, whose problem is their choices are not free, and made with reason in the light of sense.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It <i>would</i> be madness to entrust salvation to the insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Because He is not mad has God appointed One as sane as He to raise a saner world to meet the sight of everyone who chose insanity as his salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To this One is given the choice of form most suitable to him; one which will not attack the world he sees, but enter into it in quietness and show him he is mad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This One but points to an alternative, another way of looking at what he has seen before, and recognizes as the world in which he lives, and thought he understood before.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now must he question this, because the form of the alternative is one which he cannot deny, nor overlook, nor fail completely to perceive at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To each his special function is designed to be perceived as possible, and more and more desired, as it proves to him that it is an alternative he really wants.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>From this position does his sinfulness, and all the sin he sees within the world, offer him less and less.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Until he comes to understand it cost him his sanity, and stands between him and whatever hope he has of being sane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor is he left without escape from madness, for he has a special part in everyone’s escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He can no more be left outside, without a special function in the hope of peace, than could the Father overlook His Son, and pass him by in careless thoughtlessness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is dependable except God’s Love?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And where does sanity abide except in Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The One Who speaks for Him can show you this, in the alternative He chose especially for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is God’s Will that you remember this, and so emerge from deepest mourning into perfect joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Accept the function that has been assigned to you in God’s Own plan to show His Son that hell and Heaven are different, not the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And that in Heaven <i>They</i> are all the same, without the differences which would have made a hell of Heaven and a heaven of hell, had such insanity been possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The whole belief that someone loses but reflects the underlying tenet God must be insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For in this world it seems that one must gain <i>because</i> another lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If this were true, then God is mad indeed!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But what is this belief except a form of the more basic tenet, “Sin is real, and rules the world”?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For every little gain must someone lose, and pay exact amount in blood and suffering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For otherwise would evil triumph, and destruction be the total cost of any gain at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You who believe that God is mad, look carefully at this, and understand that it must be either God or this must be insane, but hardly both.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation is rebirth of the idea no one can lose for anyone to gain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And everyone <i>must</i> gain, if anyone would be a gainer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here is sanity restored.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And on this single rock of truth can faith in God’s eternal saneness rest in perfect confidence and perfect peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Reason is satisfied, for all insane beliefs can be corrected here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And sin must be impossible, if this is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the rock on which salvation rests, the vantage point from which the Holy Spirit gives meaning and direction to the plan in which your special function has a part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For here your special function is made whole, because it shares the function of the whole.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"291#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember all temptation is but this; a mad belief that God’s insanity would make you sane and give you what you want; that either God or you must lose to madness because your aims can not be reconciled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Death demands life, but life is not maintained at any cost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one can suffer for the Will of God to be fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation is His Will <i>because</i> you share it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Not for you alone, but for the Self that is the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He cannot lose, for if he could the loss would be his Father’s, and in Him no loss is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"291#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And this is sane because it is the truth.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Yet if the Holy Spirit can commute each sentence that you
