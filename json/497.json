class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You think you are the home of evil, darkness and sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You think if anyone could see the truth about you he would be repelled, recoiling from you as if from a poisonous snake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You think if what is true about you were revealed to you, you would be struck with horror so intense that you would rush to death by your own hand, living on after seeing this being impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These are beliefs so firmly fixed that it is difficult to help you see that they are based on nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That you have made mistakes is obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That you have sought salvation in strange ways; have been deceived, deceiving and afraid of foolish fantasies and savage dreams; and have bowed down to idols made of dust,—all this is true by what you now believe.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we question this, not from the point of view of what you think, but from a very different reference point, from which such idle thoughts are meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These thoughts are not according to God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These weird beliefs He does not share with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is enough to prove that they are wrong, but you do not perceive that this is so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why would you not be overjoyed to be assured that all the evil that you think you did was never done, that all your sins are nothing, that you are as pure and holy as you were created, and that light and joy and peace abide in you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your image of yourself cannot withstand the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You think that this is death, but it is life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You think you are destroyed, but you are saved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The self you made is not the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore, this self does not exist at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And anything it seems to do and think means nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is neither bad nor good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is unreal, and nothing more than that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It does not battle with the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It does not hurt him, nor attack his peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It has not changed creation, nor reduced eternal sinlessness to sin, and love to hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What power can this self you made possess, when it would contradict the Will of God?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Over and over this must be repeated, until it is accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothing can touch it, or change what God created as eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The self you made, evil and full of sin, is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God, and light and joy and peace abide in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation requires the acceptance of but one thought;—you are as God created you, not what you made of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Whatever evil you may think you did, you are as God created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whatever mistakes you made, the truth about you is unchanged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Creation is eternal and unalterable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are and will forever be exactly as you were created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Light and joy and peace abide in you because God put them there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In our longer exercise periods today, which would be most profitable if done for the first five minutes of every waking hour, begin by stating the truth about your creation:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"497#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Light and joy and peace abide in me.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>My sinlessness is guaranteed by God.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"497#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then put away your foolish self-images, and spend the rest of the practice period in trying to experience what God has given you, in place of what you have decreed for yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are what God created or what you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>One Self is true; the other is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Try to experience the unity of your one Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Try to appreciate Its Holiness and the love from which It was created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Try not to interfere with the Self which God created as you, by hiding Its majesty behind the tiny idols of evil and sinfulness you have made to replace It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let It come into Its Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here you are; This is You.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And light and joy and peace abide in you because this is so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may not be willing or even able to use the first five minutes of each hour for these exercises.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try, however, to do so when you can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>At least remember to repeat these thoughts each hour:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"497#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Light and joy and peace abide in me.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>My sinlessness is guaranteed by God.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"497#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then try to devote at least a minute or so to closing your eyes and realizing that this is a statement of the truth about you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"497#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If a situation arises that seems to be disturbing, quickly dispel the illusion of fear by repeating these thoughts again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Should you be tempted to become angry with someone, tell him silently:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"497#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Light and joy and peace abide in you.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"497#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can do much for the world’s salvation today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can do much today to bring you closer to the part in salvation that God has assigned to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"497#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you can do much today to bring the conviction to your mind that the idea for the day is true indeed.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You think you are the home of evil, darkness and sin.
