data-sentence-id=\"938#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How holy are the healed!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For in their sight their brothers share their healing and their love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Bringers of peace,—the Holy Spirit’s voice, through whom He speaks for God, Whose Voice He is,—such are God’s healers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They but speak for Him and never for themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They have no gifts but those they have from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And these they share because they know that this is what He wills.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are not special.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They are holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>They have chosen holiness, and given up all separate dreams of special attributes through which they can bestow unequal gifts on those less fortunate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Their healing has restored their wholeness so they can forgive, and join the song of prayer in which the healed sing of their union and their thanks to God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"938#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As witness to forgiveness, aid to prayer, and the effect of mercy truly taught, healing is blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And the world responds in quickened chorus through the voice of prayer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiveness shines its merciful reprieve upon each blade of grass and feathered wing and all the living things upon the earth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fear has no haven here, for love has come in all its holy oneness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Time remains only to let the last embrace of prayer rest on the earth an instant, as the world is shined away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This instant is the goal of all true healers, whom the Christ has taught to see His likeness and to teach like Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"938#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think what it means to help the Christ to heal!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can anything be holier than this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God thanks His healers, for He knows the Cause of healing is Himself, His Love, His Son, restored as His completion and returned to share with Him creation’s holy joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not ask partial healing, nor accept an idol for rememberance of Him Whose Love has never changed and never will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are as dear to Him as is the whole of His creation, for it lies in you as His eternal gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What need have you for shifting dreams within a sorry world?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not forget the gratitude of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not forget the holy grace of prayer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Do not forget forgiveness of God’s Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"938#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You first forgive, then pray, and you are healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your prayer has risen up and called to God, Who hears and answers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have understood that you forgive and pray but for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And in this understanding you are healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In prayer you have united with your Source, and understood that you have never left.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This level cannot be attained until there is no hatred in your heart, and no desire to attack the Son of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"938#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Never forget this; it is you who are God’s Son, and as you choose to be to him so are you to yourself, and God to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor will your judgment fail to reach to God, for you will give the role to Him you see in His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not choose amiss, or you will think that it is you who are creator in His place, and He is then no longer Cause but only an effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now healing is impossible, for He is blamed for your deception and your guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He Who is Love becomes the source of fear, for only fear can now be justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Vengeance is His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His great destroyer, death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And sickness, suffering and grievous loss become the lot of everyone on earth, which He abandoned to the devil’s care, swearing He will deliver it no more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"938#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Come unto Me, My children, once again, without such twisted thoughts upon your hearts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You still are holy with the Holiness Which fathered you in perfect sinlessness, and still surrounds you with the Arms of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Dream now of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then arise and lay all dreaming down forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are he your Father loves, who never left his home, nor wandered in a savage world with feet that bleed, and with a heavy heart made hard against the love that is the truth in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Give all your dreams to Christ and let Him be your Guide to healing, leading you in prayer beyond the sorry reaches of the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"938#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He comes for Me and speaks My Word to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I would recall My weary Son to Me from dreams of malice to the sweet embrace of everlasting Love and perfect peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>My Arms are open to the Son I love, who does not understand that he is healed, and that his prayers have never ceased to sing his joyful thanks in unison with all creation, in the holiness of Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Be still an instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Underneath the sounds of harsh and bitter striving and defeat there is a Voice that speaks to you of Me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Hear this an instant and you will be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Hear this an instant and you have been saved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"938#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Help Me to wake My children from the dream of retribution and a little life beset with fear, that ends so soon it might as well have never been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let Me instead remind you of eternity, in which your joy grows greater as your love extends along with Mine beyond infinity, where time and distance have no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>While you wait in sorrow Heaven’s melody is incomplete, because your song is part of the eternal harmony of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Without you is creation unfulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Return to Me Who never left My Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Listen, My child, your Father calls to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not refuse to hear the Call for Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not deny to Christ what is His Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#8:9\"><span

class=\"snr\">2</span>Lift up your hearts to greet its advent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>See the shadows fade away in gentleness; the thorns fall softly from the bleeding brow of him who is the holy Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How lovely are you, child of Holiness!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How like to Me!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How lovingly I hold you in My Heart and in My Arms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How dear is every gift to Me that you have made, who healed My Son and took him from the cross.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Arise and let My thanks be given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And with My gratitude will come the gift first of forgiveness, then eternal peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"938#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#10:1\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"938#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The universe is waiting your release because it is its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Be kind to it and to yourself, and then be kind to Me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I ask but this; that you be comforted and live no more in terror and in pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not abandon Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"938#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Remember this; whatever you may think about yourself, whatever you may think about the world, your Father needs you and will call to you until you come to Him in peace at last.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"How holy are the healed!
