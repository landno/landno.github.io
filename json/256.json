data-sentence-id=\"256#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perception selects, and makes the world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It literally picks it out as the mind directs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The laws of size and shape and brightness would hold, perhaps, if other things were equal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are not equal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For what you look for you are far more likely to discover than what you would prefer to overlook.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The still, small Voice for God is not drowned out by all the ego’s raucous screams and senseless ravings to those who want to hear It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Perception is a choice and not a fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But on this choice depends far more than you may realize as yet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For on the voice you choose to hear, and on the sights you choose to see, depends entirely your whole belief in what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Perception is a witness but to this, and never to reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet it can show you the conditions in which awareness of reality is possible, or those where it could never be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"256#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Reality needs no cooperation from you to be itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But your awareness of it needs your help, because it is your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Listen to what the ego says, and see what it directs you see, and it is sure that you will see yourself as tiny, vulnerable and afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will experience depression, a sense of worthlessness, and feelings of impermanence and unreality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will believe that you are helpless prey to forces far beyond your own control, and far more powerful than you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will think the world you made directs your destiny.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For this will be your faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But never believe because it is your faith it makes reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"256#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is another vision and another Voice in which your freedom lies, awaiting but your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And if you place your faith in Them, you will perceive another self in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This other self sees miracles as natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are as simple and as natural to it as breathing to the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are the obvious response to calls for help, the only one it makes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Miracles seem unnatural to the ego because it does not understand how separate minds can influence each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor <i>could</i> they do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But minds cannot be separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This other self is perfectly aware of this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And thus it recognizes that miracles do not affect another’s mind, only its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>They always change <i>your</i> mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>There <i>is</i> no other.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"256#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not realize the whole extent to which the idea of separation has interfered with reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Reason lies in the other self you have cut off from your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And nothing you have allowed to stay in your awareness is capable of reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How can the segment of the mind devoid of reason understand what reason is, or grasp the information it would give?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All sorts of questions may arise in it, but if the basic question stems from reason, it will not ask it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Like all that stems from reason, the basic question is obvious, simple and remains unasked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But think not reason could not answer it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"256#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s plan for your salvation could not have been established without your will and your consent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It must have been accepted by the Son of God, for what God wills for him he must receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For God wills not apart from him, nor does the Will of God wait upon time to be accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore, what joined the Will of God must be in you now, being eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You must have set aside a place in which the Holy Spirit can abide, and where He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He must have been there since the need for Him arose, and was fulfilled in the same instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Such would your reason tell you, if you listened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet such is clearly not the ego’s reasoning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your reason’s alien nature to the ego is proof you will not find the answer there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet if it must be so, it must exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And if it exists for you, and has your freedom as the purpose given it, you must be free to find it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"256#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s plan is simple; never circular and never self-defeating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He has no Thoughts except the Self-extending, and in this your will must be included.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus, there must be a part of you that knows His Will and shares it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not meaningful to ask if what must be is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But it is meaningful to ask why you are unaware of what is so, for this must have an answer if the plan of God for your salvation is complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And it must be complete, because its Source knows not of incompletion.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"256#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Where would the answer be but in the Source?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And where are you but there, where this same answer is?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your Identity, as much a true Effect of this same Source as is the answer, must therefore be together and the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>O yes, you know this, and more than this alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet any part of knowledge threatens dissociation as much as all of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And all of it will come with any part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here is the part you can accept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What reason points to you can see, because the witnesses on its behalf are clear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Only the totally insane can disregard them, and you have gone past this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Reason is a means that serves the Holy Spirit’s purpose in its own right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It is not reinterpreted and redirected from the goal of sin, as are the others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>For reason is beyond the ego’s range of means.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"256#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Faith and perception and belief can be misplaced, and serve the great deceiver’s needs as well as truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But reason has no place at all in madness, nor can it be adjusted to fit its end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Faith and belief are strong in madness, guiding perception toward what the mind has valued.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But reason enters not at all in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the perception would fall away at once, if reason were applied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no reason in insanity, for it depends entirely on reason’s absence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ego never uses it, because it does not realize that it exists.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The partially insane have access to it, and only they have need of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Knowledge does not depend on it, and madness keeps it out.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"256#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The part of mind where reason lies was dedicated, by your will in union with your Father’s, to the undoing of insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here was the Holy Spirit’s purpose accepted and accomplished, both at once.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Reason is alien to insanity, and those who use it have gained a means which cannot be applied to sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Knowledge is far beyond attainment of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But reason can serve to open doors you closed against it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"256#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have come very close to this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Faith and belief have shifted, and you have asked the question the ego will never ask.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Does not your reason tell you now the question must have come from something that you do not know, but must belong to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Faith and belief, upheld by reason, cannot fail to lead to changed perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And in this change is room made way for vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"256#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Vision extends beyond itself, as does the purpose that it serves, and all the means for its accomplishment.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Perception selects, and makes
