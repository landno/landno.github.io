data-sentence-id=\"262#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let reason take another step.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you attack whom God would heal and hate the one He loves, then you and your Creator have a different will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet if you <i>are</i> His Will, what you must then believe is that you are not yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can indeed believe this, and you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you have faith in this and see much evidence on its behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And where, you wonder, does your strange uneasiness, your sense of being disconnected, and your haunting fear of lack of meaning in yourself arise?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is as though you wandered in without a plan of any kind except to wander off, for only that seems certain.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet we have heard a very similar description earlier, but it was not of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But still this strange idea which it does accurately describe, you <i>think</i> is you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Reason would tell you that the world you see through eyes that are not yours must make no sense to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To whom would seeing such as this send back its messages?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Surely not you, whose sight is wholly independent of the eyes that look upon the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If this is not your vision, what can it show to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The brain cannot interpret what your vision sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This <i>you</i> would understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The brain interprets to the body, of which it is a part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But what it says you cannot understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet you have listened to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And long and hard you tried to understand its messages.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have not realized it is impossible to understand what fails entirely to reach you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have received no messages at all you understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For you have listened to what can never communicate at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think, then, what happens.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Denying what you are, and firm in faith that you are something else, this “something else” that you have made to be yourself becomes your sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it must be the “something else” that sees, and as <i>not</i> you, explains its sight <i>to</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your vision would, of course, render this quite unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet if your eyes are closed and you have called upon this thing to lead you, asking it to explain to you the world it sees, you have no reason not to listen, nor to suspect that what it tells you is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Reason would tell you it cannot be true <i>because</i> you do not understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God has no secrets.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>He does not lead you through a world of misery, waiting to tell you, at the journey’s end, why He did this to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What could be secret from God’s Will?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you believe that you have secrets.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What could your secrets be except another “will” that is your own, apart from His?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Reason would tell you that this is no secret that need be hidden as a sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But a mistake indeed!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let not your fear of sin protect it from correction, for the attraction of guilt is only fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here is the one emotion that you made, whatever it may seem to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is the emotion of secrecy, of private thoughts and of the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is the one emotion that opposes love, and always leads to sight of differences and loss of sameness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Here is the one emotion that keeps you blind, dependent on the self you think you made to lead you through the world it made for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your sight was given you, along with everything that you can understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will perceive no difficulty in understanding what this vision tells you, for everyone sees only what he thinks he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what your sight would show you, you will understand <i>because</i> it is the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only your vision can convey to you what you can see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It reaches you directly, without a need to be interpreted to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What needs interpretation must be alien.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor will it ever be made understandable by an interpreter you cannot understand.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Of all the messages you have received and failed to understand, this course alone is open to your understanding and can be understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is <i>your</i> language.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not understand it yet only because your whole communication is like a baby’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The sounds a baby makes and what he hears are highly unreliable, meaning different things to him at different times.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Neither the sounds he hears nor sights he sees are stable yet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But what he hears and does not understand will be his native tongue, through which he will communicate with those around him, and they with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And the strange, shifting ones he sees about him will become to him his comforters, and he will recognize his home and see them there with him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>So in each holy relationship is the ability to communicate instead of separate reborn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet a holy relationship, so recently reborn itself from an unholy relationship, and yet more ancient than the old illusion it has replaced, is like a baby now in its rebirth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Still in this infant is your vision returned to you, and he will speak the language you can understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He is not nurtured by the “something else” you thought was you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He was not given there, nor was received by anything except yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For no two brothers can unite except through Christ, Whose vision sees them one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think what is given you, my holy brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This child will teach you what you do not understand, and make it plain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For his will be no alien tongue.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He will need no interpreter to you, for it was you who taught him what he knows <i>because</i> you knew it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He could not come to anyone but you, never to “something else.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Where Christ has entered no one is alone, for never could He find a home in separate ones.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet must He be reborn into His ancient home, so seeming new and yet as old as He, a tiny newcomer, dependent on the holiness of your relationship to let Him live.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be certain God did not entrust His Son to the unworthy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothing but what is part of Him is worthy of being joined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor is it possible that anything not part of Him <i>can</i> join.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Communication must have been restored to those who join, for this they could not do through bodies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What, then, has joined them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Reason will tell you that they must have seen each other through a vision not of the body, and communicated in a language the body does not speak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor could it be a fearful sight or sound that drew them gently into one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Rather, in each the other saw a perfect shelter where his Self could be reborn in safety and in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Such did his reason tell him; such he believed <i>because</i> it was the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the first direct perception that you can make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You make it through awareness older than perception, and yet reborn in just an instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what is time to what was always so?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think what that instant brought; the recognition that the “something else” you thought was you is an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And truth came instantly, to show you where your Self must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is denial of illusions that calls on truth, for to deny illusions is to recognize that fear is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Into the holy home where fear is powerless love enters thankfully, grateful that it is one with you who joined to let it enter.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"262#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Christ comes to what is like Himself; the same, not different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For He is always drawn unto Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What is as like Him as a holy relationship?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what draws you and your brother together draws Him to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here are His sweetness and His gentle innocence protected from attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And here can He return in confidence, for faith in another is always faith in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are indeed correct in looking on your brother as His chosen home, for here you will with Him and with His Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is your Father’s Will for you, and yours with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"262#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And who is drawn to Christ is drawn to God as surely as Both are drawn to every holy relationship, the home prepared for Them as earth is turned to Heaven.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Let reason take another step.
