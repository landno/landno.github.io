class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the “dynamics” of attack is sacrifice a key idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the pivot upon which all compromise, all desperate attempts to strike a bargain, and all conflicts achieve a seeming balance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the symbol of the central theme that <i>somebody must lose.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its focus on the body is apparent, for it is always an attempt to limit loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The body is itself a sacrifice; a giving up of power in the name of saving just a little for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To see a brother in another body, separate from yours, is the expression of a wish to see a little part of him and sacrifice the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Look at the world, and you will see nothing attached to anything beyond itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All seeming entities can come a little nearer, or go a little farther off, but cannot join.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"295#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world you see is based on “sacrifice” of oneness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a picture of complete disunity and total lack of joining.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Around each entity is built a wall so seeming solid that it looks as if what is inside can never reach without, and what is out can never reach and join with what is locked away within the wall.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each part must sacrifice the other part, to keep itself complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For if they joined each one would lose its own identity, and by their separation are their selves maintained.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"295#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The little that the body fences off becomes the self, preserved through sacrifice of all the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And all the rest must lose this little part, remaining incomplete to keep its own identity intact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In this perception of yourself the body’s loss would be a sacrifice indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For sight of bodies becomes the sign that sacrifice is limited, and something still remains for you alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And for this little to belong to you are limits placed on everything outside, just as they are on everything you think is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For giving and receiving are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And to accept the limits of a body is to impose these limits on each brother whom you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For you must see him as you see yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"295#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body <i>is</i> a loss, and <i>can</i> be made to sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And while you see your brother as a body, apart from you and separate in his cell, you are demanding sacrifice of him and you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What greater sacrifice could be demanded than that God’s Son perceive himself without his Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And his Father be without His Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet every sacrifice demands that They be separate and without the Other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The memory of God must be denied if any sacrifice is asked of anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What witness to the Wholeness of God’s Son is seen within a world of separate bodies, however much he witnesses to truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is invisible in such a world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nor can his song of union and of love be heard at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet is it given him to make the world recede before his song, and sight of him replace the body’s eyes.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"295#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those who would see the witnesses to truth instead of to illusion merely ask that they might see a purpose in the world that gives it sense and makes it meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Without your special function has this world no meaning for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it can become a treasure house as rich and limitless as Heaven itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No instant passes here in which your brother’s holiness cannot be seen, to add a limitless supply to every meager scrap and tiny crumb of happiness that you allot yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"295#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can lose sight of oneness, but can not make sacrifice of its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor can you lose what you would sacrifice, nor keep the Holy Spirit from His task of showing you that it has not been lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Hear, then, the song your brother sings to you, and let the world recede, and take the rest his witness offers on behalf of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But judge him not, for you will hear no song of liberation for yourself, nor see what it is given him to witness to, that you may see it and rejoice with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Make not his holiness a sacrifice to your belief in sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You sacrifice your innocence with his, and die each time you see in him a sin deserving death.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"295#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet every instant can you be reborn, and given life again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His holiness gives life to you, who cannot die because his sinlessness is known to God; and can no more be sacrificed by you than can the light in you be blotted out because he sees it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You who would make a sacrifice of life, and make your eyes and ears bear witness to the death of God and of His holy Son, think not that you have power to make of Them what God willed not They be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In Heaven, God’s Son is not imprisoned in a body, nor is sacrificed in solitude to sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And as he is in Heaven, so must he be eternally and everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is the same forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Born again each instant, untouched by time, and far beyond the reach of any sacrifice of life or death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For neither did he make, and only one was given him by One Who knows His gifts can never suffer sacrifice and loss.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"295#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s justice rests in gentleness upon His Son, and keeps him safe from all injustice the world would lay upon him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Could it be that you could make his sins reality, and sacrifice his Father’s Will for him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Condemn him not by seeing him within the rotting prison where he sees himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is your special function to ensure the door be opened, that he may come forth to shine on you, and give you back the gift of freedom by receiving it of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is the Holy Spirit’s special function but to release the holy Son of God from the imprisonment he made to keep himself from justice?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"295#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Could your function be a task apart and separate from His Own?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"In the “dynamics” of attack is sacrifice a key idea.
