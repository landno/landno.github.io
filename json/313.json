data-sentence-id=\"313#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body is the central figure in the dreaming of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no dream without it, nor does it exist without the dream in which it acts as if it were a person to be seen and be believed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It takes the central place in every dream, which tells the story of how it was made by other bodies, born into the world outside the body, lives a little while and dies, to be united in the dust with other bodies dying like itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the brief time allotted it to live, it seeks for other bodies as its friends and enemies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its safety is its main concern.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Its comfort is its guiding rule.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It tries to look for pleasure, and avoid the things that would be hurtful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Above all, it tries to teach itself its pains and joys are different and can be told apart.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The dreaming of the world takes many forms, because the body seeks in many ways to prove it is autonomous and real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It puts things on itself that it has bought with little metal discs or paper strips the world proclaims as valuable and real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It works to get them, doing senseless things, and tosses them away for senseless things it does not need and does not even want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It hires other bodies, that they may protect it and collect more senseless things that it can call its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It looks about for special bodies that can share its dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Sometimes it dreams it is a conqueror of bodies weaker than itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But in some phases of the dream, it is the slave of bodies that would hurt and torture it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body’s serial adventures, from the time of birth to dying are the theme of every dream the world has ever had.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The “hero” of this dream will never change, nor will its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Though the dream itself takes many forms, and seems to show a great variety of places and events wherein its “hero” finds itself, the dream has but one purpose, taught in many ways.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This single lesson does it try to teach again, and still again, and yet once more; that it is cause and not effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you are its effect, and cannot be its cause.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus are you not the dreamer, but the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so you wander idly in and out of places and events that it contrives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That this is all the body does is true, for it is but a figure in a dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But who reacts to figures in a dream unless he sees them as if they were real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The instant that he sees them as they are they have no more effects on him, because he understands he gave them their effects by causing them and making them seem real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How willing are you to escape effects of all the dreams the world has ever had?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is it your wish to let no dream appear to be the cause of what it is you do?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then let us merely look upon the dream’s beginning, for the part you see is but the second part, whose cause lies in the first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one asleep and dreaming in the world remembers his attack upon himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one believes there really was a time when he knew nothing of a body, and could never have conceived this world as real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He would have seen at once that these ideas are one illusion, too ridiculous for anything but to be laughed away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How serious they now appear to be!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And no one can remember when they would have met with laughter and with disbelief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>We can remember this, if we but look directly at their cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And we will see the grounds for laughter, not a cause for fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us return the dream he gave away unto the dreamer, who perceives the dream as separate from himself and done to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Into eternity, where all is one, there crept a tiny, mad idea, at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In his forgetting did the thought become a serious idea, and possible of both accomplishment and real effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Together, we can laugh them both away, and understand that time cannot intrude upon eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is a joke to think that time can come to circumvent eternity, which <i>means</i> there is no time.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A timelessness in which is time made real; a part of God that can attack itself; a separate brother as an enemy; a mind within a body all are forms of circularity whose ending starts at its beginning, ending at its cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world you see depicts exactly what you thought you did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Except that now you think that what you did is being done to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The guilt for what you thought is being placed outside yourself, and on a guilty world that dreams your dreams and thinks your thoughts instead of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It brings its vengeance, not your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It keeps you narrowly confined within a body, which it punishes because of all the sinful things the body does within its dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have no power to make the body stop its evil deeds because you did not make it, and cannot control its actions nor its purpose nor its fate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world but demonstrates an ancient truth; you will believe that others do to you exactly what you think you did to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But once deluded into blaming them you will not see the cause of what they do, because you <i>want</i> the guilt to rest on them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How childish is the petulant device to keep your innocence by pushing guilt outside yourself, but never letting go!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not easy to perceive the jest when all around you do your eyes behold its heavy consequences, but without their trifling cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Without the cause do its effects seem serious and sad indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet they but follow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it is their cause that follows nothing and is but a jest.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In gentle laughter does the Holy Spirit perceive the cause, and looks not to effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How else could He correct your error, who have overlooked the cause entirely?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He bids you bring each terrible effect to Him that you may look together on its foolish cause and laugh with Him a while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span><i>You</i> judge effects, but <i>He</i> has judged their cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And by His judgment are effects removed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perhaps you come in tears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But hear Him say, “My brother, holy Son of God, behold your idle dream, in which this could occur.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you will leave the holy instant with your laughter and your brother’s joined with His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The secret of salvation is but this: that you are doing this unto yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No matter what the form of the attack, this still is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whoever takes the role of enemy and of attacker, still is this the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whatever seems to be the cause of any pain and suffering you feel, this is still true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For you would not react at all to figures in a dream you knew that you were dreaming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let them be as hateful and as vicious as they may, they could have no effect on you unless you failed to recognize it is your dream.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This single lesson learned will set you free from suffering, whatever form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit will repeat this one inclusive lesson of deliverance until it has been learned, regardless of the form of suffering that brings you pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whatever hurt you bring to Him He will make answer with this very simple truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For this one answer takes away the cause of every form of sorrow and of pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The form affects His answer not at all, for He would teach you but the single cause of all of them, no matter what their form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will understand that miracles reflect the simple statement, “<i>I</i> have done this thing, and it is this I would undo.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Bring, then, all forms of suffering to Him Who knows that every one is like the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He sees no differences where none exists, and He will teach you how each one is caused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>None has a different cause from all the rest, and all of them are easily undone by but a single lesson truly learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation is a secret you have kept but from yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The universe proclaims it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet to its witnesses you pay no heed at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For they attest the thing you do not want to know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They seem to keep it secret from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet you need but learn you chose but not to listen, not to see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"313#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How differently will you perceive the world when this is recognized!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you forgive the world your guilt, you will be free of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its innocence does not demand your guilt, nor does your guiltlessness rest on its sins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the obvious; a secret kept from no one but yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is this that has maintained you separate from the world, and kept your brother separate from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Now need you but to learn that both of you are innocent or guilty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The one thing that is impossible is that you be unlike each other; that they both be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is the only secret yet to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"313#13:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And it will be no secret you are healed.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The body is the central figure in the
