data-sentence-id=\"149#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Never forget that the Sonship is your salvation, for the Sonship is your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As God’s creation It is yours, and belonging to you It is His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your Self does not need salvation, but your mind needs to learn what salvation is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are not saved <i>from</i> anything, but you are saved <i>for</i> glory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Glory is your inheritance, given you by your Creator that you might extend it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet if you hate part of your Self all your understanding is lost, because you are looking on what God created as yourself without love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And since what He created is part of Him, you are denying Him His place in His Own altar.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"149#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Could you try to make God homeless and know that you are at home?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can the Son deny the Father without believing that the Father has denied him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s laws hold only for your protection, and they never hold in vain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you experience when you deny your Father is still for your protection, for the power of your will cannot be lessened without the intervention of God against it, and any limitation on your power is not the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore, look only to the power that God gave to save you, remembering that it is yours <i>because</i> it is His, and join with your brothers in His peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"149#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your peace lies in its limitlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Limit the peace you share, and your Self must be unknown to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every altar to God is part of you, because the light He created is one with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would you cut off a brother from the light that is yours?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You would not do so if you realized that you can darken only your own mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As you bring him back, so will you return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is the law of God, for the protection of the Wholeness of His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"149#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span><i>Only you can deprive yourself of anything.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not oppose this realization, for it is truly the beginning of the dawn of light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember also that the denial of this simple fact takes many forms, and these you must learn to recognize and to oppose steadfastly, without exception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is a crucial step in the reawakening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The beginning phases of this reversal are often quite painful, for as blame is withdrawn from without, there is a strong tendency to harbor it within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is difficult at first to realize that this is exactly the same thing, for there is no distinction between within and without.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"149#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If your brothers are part of you and you blame them for your deprivation, you are blaming yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you cannot blame yourself without blaming them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is why blame must be undone, not seen elsewhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Lay it to yourself and you cannot know yourself, for only the ego blames at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Self-blame is therefore ego identification, and as much an ego defense as blaming others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span><i>You cannot enter God’s Presence if you attack His Son.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When His Son lifts his voice in praise of his Creator, he will hear the Voice for his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet the Creator cannot be praised without His Son, for Their glory is shared and They are glorified together.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"149#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Christ is at God’s altar, waiting to welcome His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But come wholly without condemnation, for otherwise you will believe that the door is barred and you cannot enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The door is not barred, and it is impossible that you cannot enter the place where God would have you be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But love yourself with the Love of Christ, for so does your Father love you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can refuse to enter, but you cannot bar the door that Christ holds open.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Come unto me who hold it open for you, for while I live it cannot be shut, and I live forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God is my life and yours, and nothing is denied by God to His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"149#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>At God’s altar Christ waits for the restoration of Himself in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God knows His Son as wholly blameless as Himself, and He is approached through the appreciation of His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Christ waits for your acceptance of Him as yourself, and of His Wholeness as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For Christ is the Son of God, Who lives in His Creator and shines with His glory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Christ is the extension of the Love and the loveliness of God, as perfect as His Creator and at peace with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"149#8\"><p

wills to share as his Father shares it with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no condemnation in the Son, for there is no condemnation in the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Sharing the perfect Love of the Father the Son must share what belongs to Him, for otherwise he will not know the Father or the Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"149#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Peace be unto you who rest in God, and in whom the whole Sonship rests.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Never
