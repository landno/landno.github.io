data-sentence-id=\"116#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Kingdom is the result of premises, just as this world is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may have carried the ego’s reasoning to its logical conclusion, which is total confusion about everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you really saw this result you could not want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The only reason you could possibly want any part of it is because you do not see the whole of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are willing to look at the ego’s premises, but not at their logical outcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Is it not possible that you have done the same thing with the premises of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your creations are the logical outcome of His premises.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>His thinking has established them for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>They are exactly where they belong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>They belong in your mind as part of your identification with His, but your state of mind and your recognition of what is in it depend on what you believe about your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Whatever these beliefs may be, they are the premises that will determine what you accept into your mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"116#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is surely clear that you can both accept into your mind what is not there, and deny what is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the function God Himself gave your mind through His you may deny, but you cannot prevent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the logical outcome of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ability to see a logical outcome depends on the willingness to see it, but its truth has nothing to do with your willingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Truth is God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Share His Will and you share what He knows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Deny His Will as yours, and you are denying His Kingdom <i>and</i> yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"116#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit will direct you only so as to avoid pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Surely no one would object to this goal if he recognized it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The problem is not whether what the Holy Spirit says is true, but whether you want to listen to what He says.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You no more recognize what is painful than you know what is joyful, and are, in fact, very apt to confuse the two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit’s main function is to teach you to tell them apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What is joyful to you is painful to the ego, and as long as you are in doubt about what you are, you will be confused about joy and pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This confusion is the cause of the whole idea of sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Obey the Holy Spirit, and you will be giving up the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But you will be sacrificing nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>On the contrary, you will be gaining everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>If you believed this, there would be no conflict.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"116#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That is why you need to demonstrate the obvious to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not obvious to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You believe that doing the opposite of God’s Will can be better for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You also believe that it is possible to <i>do</i> the opposite of God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore, you believe that an impossible choice is open to you, and one which is both fearful and desirable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet God wills.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He does not wish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your will is as powerful as His because it <i>is</i> His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The ego’s wishes do not mean anything, because the ego wishes for the impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You can wish for the impossible, but you can will only with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This is the ego’s weakness and your strength.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"116#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit always sides with you and with your strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As long as you avoid His guidance in any way, you want to be weak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet weakness is frightening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What else, then, can this decision mean except that you want to be fearful?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit never asks for sacrifice, but the ego always does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you are confused about this distinction in motivation, it can only be due to projection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Projection is a confusion in motivation, and given this confusion, trust becomes impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No one gladly obeys a guide he does not trust, but this does not mean that the guide is untrustworthy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>In this case, it always means that the follower is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>However, this, too, is merely a matter of his own belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Believing that he can betray, he believes that everything can betray him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Yet this is only because he has elected to follow false guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Unable to follow this guidance without fear, he associates fear with guidance, and refuses to follow any guidance at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#5:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>If the result of this decision is confusion, this is hardly surprising.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"116#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is perfectly trustworthy, as you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God Himself trusts you, and therefore your trustworthiness is beyond question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It will always remain beyond question, however much you may question it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I said before that you are the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His Will is not an idle wish, and your identification with His Will is not optional, since it is what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Sharing His Will with me is not really open to choice, though it may seem to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The whole separation lies in this error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The only way out of the error is to decide that you do not have to decide anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Everything has been given you by God’s decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>That is His Will, and you cannot undo it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"116#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Even the relinquishment of your false decision-making prerogative, which the ego guards so jealously, is not accomplished by your wish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It was accomplished for you by the Will of God, Who has not left you comfortless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Voice will teach you how to distinguish between pain and joy, and will lead you out of the confusion you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no confusion in the mind of a Son of God, whose will must be the Will of the Father, because the Father’s Will <i>is</i> His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"116#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Miracles are in accord with the Will of God, Whose Will you do not know because you are confused about what <i>you</i> will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This means that you are confused about what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you are God’s Will and do not accept His Will, you are denying joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle is therefore a lesson in what joy is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Being a lesson in sharing it is a lesson in love, which <i>is</i> joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"116#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Every miracle is thus a lesson in truth, and by offering truth you are learning the difference between pain and joy.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The Kingdom is the result of premises, just as this world is.
