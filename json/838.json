Healing?","inlineNumber":"23."},"annotation":"M-23","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text manual-23\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"838#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s gifts can rarely be received directly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Even the most advanced of God’s teachers will give way to temptation in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would it be fair if their pupils were denied healing because of this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Bible says, “Ask in the name of Jesus Christ.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is this merely an appeal to magic?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A name does not heal, nor does an invocation call forth any special power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What does it mean to call on Jesus Christ?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What does calling on his name confer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Why is the appeal to him part of healing?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"838#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have repeatedly said that one who has perfectly accepted the Atonement for himself can heal the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Indeed, he has already done so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Temptation may recur to others, but never to this One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has become the risen Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has overcome death because he has accepted life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He has recognized himself as God created him, and in so doing he has recognized all living things as part of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is now no limit on his power, because it is the power of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>So has his name become the Name of God, for he no longer sees himself as separate from Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"838#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What does this mean for you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It means that in remembering Jesus you are remembering God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The whole relationship of the Son to the Father lies in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His part in the Sonship is also yours, and his completed learning guarantees your own success.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is he still available for help?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What did he say about this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Remember his promises, and ask yourself honestly whether it is likely that he will fail to keep them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can God fail His Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And can one who is one with God be unlike Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Who transcends the body has transcended limitation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Would the greatest teacher be unavailable to those who follow him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"838#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The name of Jesus Christ as such is but a symbol.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But it stands for love that is not of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a symbol that is safely used as a replacement for the many names of all the gods to which you pray.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It becomes the shining symbol for the Word of God, so close to what it stands for that the little space between the two is lost, the moment that the name is called to mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remembering the name of Jesus Christ is to give thanks for all the gifts that God has given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And gratitude to God becomes the way in which He is remembered, for love cannot be far behind a grateful heart and thankful mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God enters easily, for these are the true conditions for your homecoming.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"838#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Jesus has led the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Why would you not be grateful to him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has asked for love, but only that he might give it to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do not love yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But in his eyes your loveliness is so complete and flawless that he sees in it an image of his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You become the symbol of his Father here on earth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To you he looks for hope, because in you he sees no limit and no stain to mar your beautiful perfection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In his eyes Christ’s vision shines in perfect constancy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He has remained with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Would you not learn the lesson of salvation through his learning?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Why would you choose to start again, when he has made the journey for you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"838#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one on earth can grasp what Heaven is, or what its one Creator really means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet we have witnesses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is to them that wisdom should appeal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There have been those whose learning far exceeds what we can learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor would we teach the limitations we have laid on us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No one who has become a true and dedicated teacher of God forgets his brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet what he can offer them is limited by what he learns himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Then turn to one who laid all limits by, and went beyond the farthest reach of learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He will take you with him, for he did not go alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And you were with him then, as you are now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"838#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This course has come from him because his words have reached you in a language you can love and understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Are other teachers possible, to lead the way to those who speak in different tongues and appeal to different symbols?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Certainly there are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would God leave anyone without a very present help in time of trouble; a savior who can symbolize Himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet do we need a many-faceted curriculum, not because of content differences, but because symbols must shift and change to suit the need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Jesus has come to answer yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In him you find God’s Answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"838#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do you, then, teach with him, for he is with you; he is always here.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"God’s gifts can rarely be received directly.
