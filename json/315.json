does is to undo.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus it cancels out the interference to what has been done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not add, but merely takes away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what it takes away is long since gone, but being kept in memory appears to have immediate effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This world was over long ago.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The thoughts that made it are no longer in the mind that thought of them and loved them for a little while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The miracle but shows the past is gone, and what has truly gone has no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Remembering a cause can but produce illusions of its presence, not effects.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All the effects of guilt are here no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For guilt is over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In its passing went its consequences, left without a cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Why would you cling to it in memory if you did not desire its effects?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remembering is as selective as perception, being its past tense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is perception of the past as if it were occurring now, and still were there to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Memory, like perception, is a skill made up by you to take the place of what God gave in your creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And like all the things you made, it can be used to serve another purpose, and to be the means for something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It can be used to heal and not to hurt, if you so wish it be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing employed for healing represents an effort to do anything at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a recognition that you have no needs which mean that something must be done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is an unselective memory, that is not used to interfere with truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All things the Holy Spirit can employ for healing have been given Him, without the content and the purposes for which they have been made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are but skills without an application.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They await their use.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They have no dedication and no aim.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit can indeed make use of memory, for God Himself is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet this is not a memory of past events, but only of a present state.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are so long accustomed to believe that memory holds only what is past, that it is hard for you to realize it is a skill that can remember <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The limitations on remembering the world imposes on it are as vast as those you let the world impose on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no link of memory to the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you would have it there, then there it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But only your desire made the link, and only you have held it to a part of time where guilt appears to linger still.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s use of memory is quite apart from time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He does not seek to use it as a means to keep the past, but rather as a way to let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Memory holds the message it receives, and does what it is given it to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not write the message, nor appoint what it is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Like to the body, it is purposeless within itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if it seems to serve to cherish ancient hate, and gives you pictures of injustices and hurts that you were saving, this is what you asked its message be and that it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Committed to its vaults, the history of all the body’s past is hidden there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All of the strange associations made to keep the past alive, the present dead, are stored within it, waiting your command that they be brought to you, and lived again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And thus do their effects appear to be increased by time, which took away their cause.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet time is but another phase of what does nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It works hand in hand with all the other attributes with which you seek to keep concealed the truth about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Time neither takes away nor can restore.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet you make strange use of it, as if the past had caused the present, which is but a consequence in which no change can be made possible because its cause has gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet change must have a cause that will endure, or else it will not last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No change can be made in the present if its cause is past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only the past is held in memory as you make use of it, and so it is a way to hold the past against the now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember nothing that you taught yourself, for you were badly taught.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And who would keep a senseless lesson in his mind, when he can learn and can preserve a better one?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When ancient memories of hate appear, remember that their cause is gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so you cannot understand what they are for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let not the cause that you would give them now be what it was that made them what they were, or seemed to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Be glad that it is gone, for this is what you would be pardoned from.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And see, instead, the new effects of cause accepted <i>now,</i> with consequences <i>here.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They will surprise you with their loveliness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The ancient new ideas they bring will be the happy consequences of a Cause so ancient that It far exceeds the span of memory which your perception sees.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the Cause the Holy Spirit has remembered for you, when you would forget.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not past because He let It not be unremembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It has never changed, because there never was a time in which He did not keep It safely in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its consequences will indeed seem new, because you thought that you remembered not their Cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet was It never absent from your mind, for it was not your Father’s Will that He be unremembered by His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What <i>you</i> remember never was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It came from causelessness which you confused with cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It can deserve but laughter, when you learn you have remembered consequences that were causeless and could never be effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle reminds you of a Cause forever present, perfectly untouched by time and interference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Never changed from what It is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you are Its Effect, as changeless and as perfect as Itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Its memory does not lie in the past, nor waits the future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is not revealed in miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>They but remind you that It has not gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>When you forgive It for your sins, It will no longer be denied.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who have sought to lay a judgment on your own Creator cannot understand it is not He Who laid a judgment on His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You would deny Him His Effects, yet have They never been denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There was no time in which His Son could be condemned for what was causeless and against His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What your remembering would witness to is but the fear of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has not done the thing you fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No more have you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so your innocence has not been lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You need no healing to be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>In quietness, see in the miracle a lesson in allowing Cause to have Its Own Effects, and doing nothing that would interfere.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle comes quietly into the mind that stops an instant and is still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It reaches gently from that quiet time, and from the mind it healed in quiet then, to other minds to share its quietness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And they will join in doing nothing to prevent its radiant extension back into the Mind which caused all minds to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Born out of sharing, there can be no pause in time to cause the miracle delay in hastening to all unquiet minds, and bringing them an instant’s stillness, when the memory of God returns to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Their own remembering is quiet now, and what has come to take its place will not be wholly unremembered afterwards.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He to Whom time is given offers thanks for every quiet instant given Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For in that instant is God’s memory allowed to offer all its treasures to the Son of God, for whom they have been kept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How gladly does He offer them unto the one for whom He has been given them!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And His Creator shares His thanks, because He would not be deprived of His Effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The instant’s silence that His Son accepts gives welcome to eternity and Him, and lets Them enter where They would abide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For in that instant does the Son of God do nothing that would make himself afraid.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How instantly the memory of God arises in the mind that has no fear to keep the memory away!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its own remembering has gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no past to keep its fearful image in the way of glad awakening to present peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The trumpets of eternity resound throughout the stillness, yet disturb it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what is now remembered is not fear, but rather is the Cause that fear was made to render unremembered and undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The stillness speaks in gentle sounds of love the Son of God remembers from before his own remembering came in between the present and the past, to shut them out.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"315#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now is the Son of God at last aware of present Cause and Its benign Effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now does he understand what he has made is causeless, having no effects at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has done nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And in seeing this, he understands he never had a need for doing anything, and never did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His Cause <i>is</i> Its Effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There never was a cause beside It that could generate a different past or future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#14:7\"><span

little gap between illusions and reality than to allow the memory of God to flow across it, making it a bridge an instant will suffice to reach beyond?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For God has closed it with Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His memory has not gone by, and left a stranded Son forever on a shore where he can glimpse another shore that he can never reach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His Father wills that he be lifted up and gently carried over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He has built the bridge, and it is He Who will transport His Son across it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"315#15:8\"><span
