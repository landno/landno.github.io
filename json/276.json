love’s purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Love offers everything forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Hold back but one belief, one offering, and love is gone, because you asked a substitute to take its place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And now must war, the substitute for peace, come with the one alternative that you can choose for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your choosing it has given it all the reality it seems to have.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"276#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Beliefs will never openly attack each other because conflicting outcomes are impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But an unrecognized belief is a decision to war in secret, where the results of conflict are kept unknown and never brought to reason, to be considered sensible or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And many senseless outcomes have been reached, and meaningless decisions have been made and kept hidden, to become beliefs now given power to direct all subsequent decisions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Mistake you not the power of these hidden warriors to disrupt your peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it is at their mercy while you decide to leave it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The secret enemies of peace, your least decision to choose attack instead of love, unrecognized and swift to challenge you to combat and to violence far more inclusive than you think, are there by your election.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not deny their presence nor their terrible results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All that can be denied is their reality, but not their outcome.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"276#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All that is ever cherished as a hidden belief, to be defended though unrecognized, is faith in specialness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This takes many forms, but always clashes with the reality of God’s creation and with the grandeur that He gave His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What else could justify attack?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For who could hate someone whose Self is his, and Whom he knows?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only the special could have enemies, for they are different and not the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And difference of any kind imposes orders of reality, and a need to judge that cannot be escaped.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"276#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What God created cannot be attacked, for there is nothing in the universe unlike itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But what is different calls for judgment, and this must come from someone “better,” someone incapable of being like what he condemns, “above” it, sinless by comparison with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus does specialness become a means and end at once.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For specialness not only sets apart, but serves as grounds from which attack on those who seem “beneath” the special one is “natural” and “just.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The special ones feel weak and frail because of differences, for what would make them special <i>is</i> their enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet they protect its enmity and call it “friend.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>On its behalf they fight against the universe, for nothing in the world they value more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"276#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Specialness is the great dictator of the wrong decisions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is the grand illusion of what you are and what your brother is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And here is what must make the body dear and worth preserving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Specialness must be defended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Illusions can attack it, and they do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For what your brother must become to keep your specialness <i>is</i> an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He who is “worse” than you must be attacked, so that your specialness can live on his defeat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For specialness is triumph, and its victory is his defeat and shame.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>How can he live, with all your sins upon him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And who must be his conqueror but you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"276#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would it be possible for you to hate your brother if you were like him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Could you attack him if you realized you journey with him, to a goal that is the same?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you not help him reach it in every way you could, if his attainment of it were perceived as yours?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are his enemy in specialness; his friend in a shared purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Specialness can never share, for it depends on goals that you alone can reach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And he must never reach them, or your goal is jeopardized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Can love have meaning where the goal is triumph?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And what decision can be made for this that will not hurt you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"276#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your brother is your friend because his Father created him like you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no difference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have been given to your brother that love might be extended, not cut off from him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you keep is lost to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God gave you and your brother Himself, and to remember this is now the only purpose that you share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And so it is the only one you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Could you attack your brother if you chose to see no specialness of any kind between you and him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Look fairly at whatever makes you give your brother only partial welcome, or would let you think that you are better off apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Is it not always your belief your specialness is limited by your relationship?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And is not this the “enemy” that makes you and your brother illusions to each other?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"276#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The fear of God and of your brother comes from each unrecognized belief in specialness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you demand your brother bow to it against his will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And God Himself must honor it or suffer vengeance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Every twinge of malice, or stab of hate or wish to separate arises here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For here the purpose that you and your brother share becomes obscured from both of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You would oppose this course because it teaches you you and your brother are alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have no purpose that is not the same, and none your Father does not share with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For your relationship has been made clean of special goals.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And would you now defeat the goal of holiness that Heaven gave it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What perspective can the special have that does not change with every seeming blow, each slight, or fancied judgment on themselves?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"276#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those who are special must defend illusions against the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For what is specialness but an attack upon the Will of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You love your brother not while it is this you would defend against him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is what he attacks, and you protect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here is the ground of battle which you wage against him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here must he be your enemy and not your friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"276#9:7\"><span
