data-sentence-id=\"288#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Minds that are joined and recognize they are, can feel no guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For they cannot attack, and they rejoice that this is so, seeing their safety in this happy fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Their joy is in the innocence they see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thus they seek for it, because it is their purpose to behold it and rejoice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everyone seeks for what will bring him joy as he defines it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is not the aim, as such, that varies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet it is the way in which the aim is seen that makes the choice of means inevitable, and beyond the hope of change unless the aim is changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And then the means are chosen once again, as what will bring rejoicing is defined another way and sought for differently.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"288#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perception’s basic law could thus be said, “You will rejoice at what you see because you see it to rejoice.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And while you think that suffering and sin will bring you joy, so long will they be there for you to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing is harmful or beneficent apart from what you wish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is your wish that makes it what it is in its effects on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Because you chose it as a means to gain these same effects, believing them to be the bringers of rejoicing and of joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Even in Heaven does this law obtain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Son of God creates to bring him joy, sharing his Father’s purpose in his own creation, that his joy might be increased, and God’s along with his.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"288#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You maker of a world that is not so, take rest and comfort in another world where peace abides.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This world you bring with you to all the weary eyes and tired hearts that look on sin and beat its sad refrain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>From you can come their rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>From you can rise a world they will rejoice to look upon, and where their hearts are glad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In you there is a vision that extends to all of them, and covers them in gentleness and light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in this widening world of light the darkness that they thought was there is pushed away, until it is but distant shadows, far away, not long to be remembered as the sun shines them to nothingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And all their “evil” thoughts and “sinful” hopes, their dreams of guilt and merciless revenge, and every wish to hurt and kill and die, will disappear before the sun you bring.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"288#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you not do this for the Love of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And for <i>yourself?</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For think what it would do for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your “evil” thoughts that haunt you now will seem increasingly remote and far away from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And they go farther and farther off, because the sun in you has risen that they may be pushed away before the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They linger for a while, a little while, in twisted forms too far away for recognition, and are gone forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in the sunlight you will stand in quiet, in innocence and wholly unafraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And from you will the rest you found extend, so that your peace can never fall away and leave you homeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Those who offer peace to everyone have found a home in Heaven the world cannot destroy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For it is large enough to hold the world within its peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"288#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In you is all of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every leaf that falls is given life in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each bird that ever sang will sing again in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And every flower that ever bloomed has saved its perfume and its loveliness for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What aim can supersede the Will of God and of His Son, that Heaven be restored to him for whom it was created as his only home?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing before and nothing after it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No other place; no other state nor time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nothing beyond nor nearer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>In any form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This can you bring to all the world, and all the thoughts that entered it and were mistaken for a little while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"288#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>How better could your own mistakes be brought to truth than by your willingness to bring the light of Heaven with you, as you walk beyond the world of darkness into light?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Minds that are joined and recognize they are, can
