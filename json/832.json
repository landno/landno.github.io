Thoughts?","inlineNumber":"17."},"annotation":"M-17","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text manual-17\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"832#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is a crucial question both for teacher and pupil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If this issue is mishandled, the teacher of God has hurt himself and has also attacked his pupil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This strengthens fear, and makes the magic seem quite real to both of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How to deal with magic thus becomes a major lesson for the teacher of God to master.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His first responsibility in this is not to attack it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If a magic thought arouses anger in any form, God’s teacher can be sure that he is strengthening his own belief in sin and has condemned himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He can be sure as well that he has asked for depression, pain, fear and disaster to come to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Let him remember, then, it is not this that he would teach, because it is not this that he would learn.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"832#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is, however, a temptation to respond to magic in a way that reinforces it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor is this always obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It can, in fact, be easily concealed beneath a wish to help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is this double wish that makes the help of little value, and must lead to undesired outcomes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor should it be forgotten that the outcome that results will always come to teacher and to pupil alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How many times has it been emphasized that you give but to yourself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And where could this be better shown than in the kinds of help the teacher of God gives to those who need his aid?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Here is his gift most clearly given him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For he will give only what he has chosen for himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And in this gift is his judgment upon the holy Son of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"832#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is easiest to let error be corrected where it is most apparent, and errors can be recognized by their results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A lesson truly taught can lead to nothing but release for teacher and pupil, who have shared in one intent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Attack can enter only if perception of separate goals has entered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And this must indeed have been the case if the result is anything but joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The single aim of the teacher turns the divided goal of the pupil into one direction, with the call for help becoming his one appeal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This then is easily responded to with just one answer, and this answer will enter the teacher’s mind unfailingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>From there it shines into his pupil’s mind, making it one with his.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"832#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps it will be helpful to remember that no one can be angry at a fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is always an interpretation that gives rise to negative emotions, regardless of their seeming justification by what <i>appears</i> as facts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Regardless, too, of the intensity of the anger that is aroused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It may be merely slight irritation, perhaps too mild to be even clearly recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Or it may also take the form of intense rage, accompanied by thoughts of violence, fantasied or apparently acted out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All of these reactions are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They obscure the truth, and this can never be a matter of degree.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Either truth is apparent, or it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It cannot be partially recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Who is unaware of truth must look upon illusions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"832#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Anger in response to perceived magic thoughts is a basic cause of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Consider what this reaction means, and its centrality in the world’s thought system becomes apparent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A magic thought, by its mere presence, acknowledges a separation from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It states, in the clearest form possible, that the mind which believes it has a separate will that can oppose the Will of God, also believes it can succeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That this can hardly be a fact is obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet that it can be believed as fact is equally obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And herein lies the birthplace of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Who usurps the place of God and takes it for himself now has a deadly “enemy.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And he must stand alone in his protection, and make himself a shield to keep him safe from fury that can never be abated, and vengeance that can never be satisfied.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"832#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can this unfair battle be resolved?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its ending is inevitable, for its outcome must be death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How, then, can one believe in one’s defenses?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Magic again must help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forget the battle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Accept it as a fact, and then forget it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not remember the impossible odds against you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not remember the immensity of the “enemy,” and do not think about your frailty in comparison.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Accept your separation, but do not remember how it came about.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Believe that you have won it, but do not retain the slightest memory of Who your great “opponent” really is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Projecting your “forgetting” onto Him, it seems to you He has forgotten, too.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"832#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But what will now be your reaction to all magic thoughts?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They can but reawaken sleeping guilt, which you have hidden but have not let go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each one says clearly to your frightened mind, “You have usurped the place of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think not He has forgotten.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here we have the fear of God most starkly represented.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For in that thought has guilt already raised madness to the throne of God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And now there is no hope.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Except to kill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Here is salvation now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>An angry father pursues his guilty son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Kill or be killed, for here alone is choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Beyond this there is none, for what was done cannot be done without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#7:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>The stain of blood can never be removed, and anyone who bears this stain on him must meet with death.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"832#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Into this hopeless situation God sends His teachers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They bring the light of hope from God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is a way in which escape is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It can be learned and taught, but it requires patience and abundant willingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Given that, the lesson’s manifest simplicity stands out like an intense white light against a black horizon, for such it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If anger comes from an interpretation and not a fact, it is never justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Once this is even dimly grasped, the way is open.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Now it is possible to take the next step.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The interpretation can be changed at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Magic thoughts need not lead to condemnation, for they do not really have the power to give rise to guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And so they can be overlooked, and thus forgotten in the truest sense.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"832#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Madness but seems terrible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In truth it has no power to make anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Like the magic which becomes its servant, it neither attacks nor protects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To see it and to recognize its thought system is to look on nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can nothing give rise to anger?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Hardly so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Remember, then, teacher of God, that anger recognizes a reality that is not there; yet is the anger certain witness that you do believe in it as fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Now is escape impossible, until you see you have responded to your own interpretation, which you have projected on an outside world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let this grim sword be taken from you now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>There is no death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This sword does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The fear of God is causeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"832#9:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>But His Love is Cause of everything beyond all fear, and thus forever real and always true.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"This
