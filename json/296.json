data-sentence-id=\"296#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is not difficult to understand the reasons why you do not ask the Holy Spirit to solve all problems for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He has not greater difficulty in resolving some than others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every problem is the same to Him, because each one is solved in just the same respect and through the same approach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The aspects that need solving do not change, whatever form the problem seems to take.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A problem can appear in many forms, and it will do so while the problem lasts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It serves no purpose to attempt to solve it in a special form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It will recur and then recur again and yet again, until it has been answered for all time and will not rise again in any form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And only then are you released from it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"296#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit offers you release from every problem that you think you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are the same to Him because each one, regardless of the form it seems to take, is a demand that someone suffer loss and make a sacrifice that you might gain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And when the situation is worked out so no one loses is the problem gone, because it was an error in perception that now has been corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>One mistake is not more difficult for Him to bring to truth than is another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For there <i>is</i> but one mistake; the whole idea that loss is possible, and could result in gain for anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If this were true, then God would be unfair; sin would be possible, attack be justified and vengeance fair.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"296#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This one mistake, in any form, has one correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no loss; to think there is, is a mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have no problems, though you think you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet you could not think so if you saw them vanish one by one, without regard to size, complexity, or place and time, or any attribute which you perceive that makes each one seem different from the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Think not the limits you impose on what you see can limit God in any way.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"296#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle of justice can correct all errors.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every problem is an error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It does injustice to the Son of God, and therefore is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit does not evaluate injustices as great or small, or more or less.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They have no properties to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They are mistakes from which the Son of God is suffering, but needlessly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so He takes the thorns and nails away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He does not pause to judge whether the hurt be large or little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He makes but one judgment; that to hurt God’s Son must be unfair and therefore is not so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"296#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who believe it safe to give but some mistakes to be corrected while you keep the others to yourself, remember this: Justice is total.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no such thing as partial justice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If the Son of God is guilty then is he condemned, and he deserves no mercy from the God of justice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But ask not God to punish him because <i>you</i> find him guilty and would have him die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God offers you the means to see his innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Would it be fair to punish him because you will not look at what is there to see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Each time you keep a problem for yourself to solve, or judge that it is one that has no resolution, you have made it great, and past the hope of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You deny the miracle of justice <i>can</i> be fair.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"296#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If God is just, then can there be no problems that justice cannot solve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But you believe that some injustices are fair and good, and necessary to preserve yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is these problems that you think are great and cannot be resolved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For there are those you want to suffer loss, and no one whom you wish to be preserved from sacrifice entirely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Consider once again your special function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>One is given you to see in him his perfect sinlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you will ask no sacrifice of him because you could not will he suffer loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The miracle of justice you call forth will rest on you as surely as on him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nor will the Holy Spirit be content until it is received by everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For what you give to Him is everyone’s, and by your giving it can He ensure that everyone receives it equally.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"296#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think, then, how great your own release will be when you are willing to receive correction for all your problems.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will not keep one, for pain in any form you will not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you will see each little hurt resolved before the Holy Spirit’s gentle sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For all of them <i>are</i> little in His sight, and worth no more than just a tiny sigh before they disappear, to be forever undone and unremembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What seemed once to be a special problem, a mistake without a remedy, or an affliction without a cure, has been transformed into a universal blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Sacrifice is gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in its place the Love of God can be remembered, and will shine away all memory of sacrifice and loss.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"296#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God cannot be remembered until justice is loved instead of feared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He cannot be unjust to anyone or anything, because He knows that everything that is belongs to Him, and will forever be as He created it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing He loves but must be sinless and beyond attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your special function opens wide the door beyond which is the memory of His Love kept perfectly intact and undefiled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And all you need to do is but to wish that Heaven be given you instead of hell, and every bolt and barrier that seems to hold the door securely barred and locked will merely fall away and disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"296#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For it is not your Father’s Will that you should offer or receive less than He gave, when He created you in perfect love.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is not difficult to understand the reasons why you do not ask the Holy Spirit to solve all problems for you.
