Teaching","inlineNumber":"III."},"annotation":"T-16.III","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-16-sect-3\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"204#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have already learned that everyone teaches, and teaches all the time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may have taught well, and yet you may not have learned how to accept the comfort of your teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you will consider what you have taught, and how alien it is to what you thought you knew, you will be compelled to realize that your Teacher came from beyond your thought system.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore He could look upon it fairly, and perceive it was untrue.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He must have done so from the basis of a very different thought system, and one with nothing in common with yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For certainly what He has taught, and what you have taught through Him, have nothing in common with what you taught before He came.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And the results have been to bring peace where there was pain, and suffering has disappeared to be replaced by joy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"204#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may have taught freedom, but you have not learned how to be free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I said earlier, “By their fruits ye shall know them, and they shall know themselves.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it is certain that you judge yourself according to your teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego’s teaching produces immediate results, because its decisions are immediately accepted as your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this acceptance means that you are willing to judge yourself accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Cause and effect are very clear in the ego’s thought system, because all your learning has been directed toward establishing the relationship between them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And would you not have faith in what you have so diligently taught yourself to believe?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet remember how much care you have exerted in choosing its witnesses, and in avoiding those which spoke for the cause of truth and its effects.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"204#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Does not the fact that you have not learned what you have taught show you that you do not perceive the Sonship as one?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And does it not also show you that you do not regard <i>yourself</i> as one?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it is impossible to teach successfully wholly without conviction, and it is equally impossible that conviction be outside of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You could never have taught freedom unless you did believe in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it must be that what you taught came from yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet this Self you clearly do not know, and do not recognize It even though It functions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What functions must be there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And it is only if you deny what It has done that you could possibly deny Its Presence.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"204#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is a course in how to know yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have taught what you are, but have not let what you are teach you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have been very careful to avoid the obvious, and not to see the real cause and effect relationship that is perfectly apparent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet within you is everything you taught.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What can it be that has not learned it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It must be this part that is really outside yourself, not by your own projection, but in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it is this part that you have taken in that is not you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What you accept into your mind does not really change it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Illusions are but beliefs in what is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And the seeming conflict between truth and illusion can only be resolved by separating yourself from the illusion and not from truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"204#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your teaching has already done this, for the Holy Spirit is part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Created by God, He left neither God nor His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is both God and you, as you are God and Him together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For God’s Answer to the separation added more to you than you tried to take away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He protected both your creations and you together, keeping one with you what you would exclude.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And they will take the place of what you took in to replace them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are quite real, as part of the Self you do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They communicate to you through the Holy Spirit, and their power and gratitude to you for their creation they offer gladly to your teaching of yourself, who is their home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You who are host to God are also host to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For nothing real has ever left the mind of its creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And what is not real was never there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"204#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are not two selves in conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What is beyond God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you who hold Him and whom He holds are the universe, all else must be outside, where nothing is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have taught this, and from far off in the universe, yet not beyond yourself, the witnesses to your teaching have gathered to help you learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Their gratitude has joined with yours and God’s to strengthen your faith in what you taught.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For what you taught is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Alone, you stand outside your teaching and apart from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But with them you must learn that you but taught yourself, and learned from the conviction you shared with them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"204#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This year you will begin to learn, and make learning commensurate with teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have chosen this by your own willingness to teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Though you seemed to suffer for it, the joy of teaching will yet be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the joy of teaching is in the learner, who offers it to the teacher in gratitude, and shares it with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As you learn, your gratitude to your Self, Who teaches you what He is, will grow and help you honor Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will learn His power and strength and purity, and love Him as His Father does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His Kingdom has no limits and no end, and there is nothing in Him that is not perfect and eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All this is <i>you,</i> and nothing outside of this <i>is</i> you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"204#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To your most holy Self all praise is due for what you are, and for what He is Who created you as you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Sooner or later must everyone bridge the gap he imagines exists between his selves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each one builds this bridge, which carries him across the gap as soon as he is willing to expend some little effort on behalf of bridging it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His little efforts are powerfully supplemented by the strength of Heaven, and by the united will of all who make Heaven what it is, being joined within it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so the one who would cross over is literally transported there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"204#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your bridge is builded stronger than you think, and your foot is planted firmly on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Have no fear that the attraction of those who stand on the other side and wait for you will not draw you safely across.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"204#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For you will come where you would be, and where your Self awaits you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"We have already learned that everyone teaches, and teaches all the time.
