<span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may wonder why it is so crucial that you look upon your hatred and realize its full extent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may also think that it would be easy enough for the Holy Spirit to show it to you, and to dispel it without the need for you to raise it to awareness yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet there is one more obstacle you have interposed between yourself and the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We have said that no one will countenance fear if he recognizes it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet in your disordered state of mind you are not afraid of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not like it, but it is not your desire to attack that really frightens you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are not seriously disturbed by your hostility.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You keep it hidden because you are more afraid of what it covers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You could look even upon the ego’s darkest cornerstone without fear if you did not believe that, without the ego, you would find within yourself something you fear even more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You are not really afraid of crucifixion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Your real terror is of redemption.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Under the ego’s dark foundation is the memory of God, and it is of this that you are really afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this memory would instantly restore you to your proper place, and it is this place that you have sought to leave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your fear of attack is nothing compared to your fear of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You would be willing to look even upon your savage wish to kill God’s Son, if you did not believe that it saves you from love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For this wish caused the separation, and you have protected it because you do not want the separation healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You realize that, by removing the dark cloud that obscures it, your love for your Father would impel you to answer His Call and leap into Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You believe that attack is salvation because it would prevent you from this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For still deeper than the ego’s foundation, and much stronger than it will ever be, is your intense and burning love of God, and His for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is what you really want to hide.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In honesty, is it not harder for you to say “I love” than “I hate”?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You associate love with weakness and hatred with strength, and your own real power seems to you as your real weakness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For you could not control your joyous response to the call of love if you heard it, and the whole world you thought you made would vanish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit, then, seems to be attacking your fortress, for you would shut out God, and He does not will to be excluded.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have built your whole insane belief system because you think you would be helpless in God’s Presence, and you would save yourself from His Love because you think it would crush you into nothingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are afraid it would sweep you away from yourself and make you little, because you believe that magnitude lies in defiance, and that attack is grandeur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You think you have made a world God would destroy; and by loving Him, which you do, you would throw this world away, which you <i>would.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore, you have used the world to cover your love, and the deeper you go into the blackness of the ego’s foundation, the closer you come to the Love that is hidden there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span><i>And it is this that frightens you.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can accept insanity because you made it, but you cannot accept love because you did not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You would rather be a slave of the crucifixion than a Son of God in redemption.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your individual death seems more valuable than your living oneness, for what is given you is not so dear as what you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are more afraid of God than of the ego, and love cannot enter where it is not welcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But hatred can, for it enters of its own volition and cares not for yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You must look upon your illusions and not keep them hidden, because they do not rest on their own foundation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In concealment they appear to do so, and thus they seem to be self-sustained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the fundamental illusion on which the others rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For beneath them, and concealed as long as they are hidden, is the loving mind that thought it made them in anger.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And the pain in this mind is so apparent, when it is uncovered, that its need of healing cannot be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Not all the tricks and games you offer it can heal it, for here is the real crucifixion of God’s Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And yet he is not crucified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is both his pain and his healing, for the Holy Spirit’s vision is merciful and His remedy is quick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not hide suffering from His sight, but bring it gladly to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Lay before His eternal sanity all your hurt, and let Him heal you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not leave any spot of pain hidden from His light, and search your mind carefully for any thoughts you may fear to uncover.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For He will heal every little thought you have kept to hurt you and cleanse it of its littleness, restoring it to the magnitude of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Beneath all the grandiosity you hold so dear is your real call for help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you call for love to your Father as your Father calls you to Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In that place which you have hidden, you will only to unite with the Father, in loving remembrance of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will find this place of truth as you see it in your brothers, for though they may deceive themselves, like you they long for the grandeur that is in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And perceiving it you will welcome it, and it will be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For grandeur is the right of God’s Son, and no illusions can satisfy him or save him from what he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only his love is real, and he will be content only with his reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Save him from his illusions that you may accept the magnitude of your Father in peace and joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But exempt no one from your love, or you will be hiding a dark place in your mind where the Holy Spirit is not welcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus you will exempt yourself from His healing power, for by not offering total love you will not be healed completely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Healing must be as complete as fear, for love cannot enter where there is one spot of fear to mar its welcome.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who prefer separation to sanity cannot obtain it in your right mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You were at peace until you asked for special favor.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And God did not give it for the request was alien to Him, and you could not ask this of a Father Who truly loved His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore you made of Him an unloving father, demanding of Him what only such a father could give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And the peace of God’s Son was shattered, for he no longer understood his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He feared what he had made, but still more did he fear his real Father, having attacked his own glorious equality with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In peace he needed nothing and asked for nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In war he demanded everything and found nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For how could the gentleness of love respond to his demands, except by departing in peace and returning to the Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If the Son did not wish to remain in peace, he could not remain at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For a darkened mind cannot live in the light, and it must seek a place of darkness where it can believe it is where it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God did not allow this to happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet you demanded that it happen, and therefore believed that it was so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"167#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To “single out” is to “make alone,” and thus make lonely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God did not do this to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Could He set you apart, knowing that your peace lies in His Oneness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He denied you only your request for pain, for suffering is not of His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Having given you creation, He could not take it from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He could but answer your insane request with a sane answer that would abide with you in your insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And this He did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No one who hears His answer but will give up insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For His answer is the reference point beyond illusions, from which you can look back on them and see them as insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"167#12:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But seek this place and you will find it, for Love is in you and will lead you there.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You may wonder why it is so crucial that you look
