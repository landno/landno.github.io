data-sentence-id=\"064#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our emphasis is now on healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The miracle is the means, the Atonement is the principle, and healing is the result.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To speak of “a miracle of healing” is to combine two orders of reality inappropriately.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Healing is not a miracle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Atonement, or the final miracle, is a remedy and any type of healing is a result.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The kind of error to which Atonement is applied is irrelevant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All healing is essentially the release from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To undertake this you cannot be fearful yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You do not understand healing because of your own fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"064#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A major step in the Atonement plan is to undo error at all levels.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Sickness or “not-right-mindedness” is the result of level confusion, because it always entails the belief that what is amiss on one level can adversely affect another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We have referred to miracles as the means of correcting level confusion, for all mistakes must be corrected at the level on which they occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only the mind is capable of error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The body can act wrongly only when it is responding to misthought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The body cannot create, and the belief that it can, a fundamental error, produces all physical symptoms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Physical illness represents a belief in magic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The whole distortion that made magic rests on the belief that there is a creative ability in matter which the mind cannot control.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This error can take two forms; it can be believed that the mind can miscreate in the body, or that the body can miscreate in the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>When it is understood that the mind, the only level of creation, cannot create beyond itself, neither type of confusion need occur.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"064#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only the mind can create because spirit has already been created, and the body is a learning device for the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Learning devices are not lessons in themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Their purpose is merely to facilitate learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The worst a faulty use of a learning device can do is to fail to facilitate learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It has no power in itself to introduce actual learning errors.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The body, if properly understood, shares the invulnerability of the Atonement to two-edged application.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is not because the body is a miracle, but because it is not inherently open to misinterpretation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Its abilities can be and frequently are overevaluated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>However, it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The term “unworthy” here implies only that it is not necessary to protect the mind by denying the unmindful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#3:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>If one denies this unfortunate aspect of the mind’s power, one is also denying the power itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"064#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All material means that you accept as remedies for bodily ills are restatements of magic principles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the first step in believing that the body makes its own illness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a second misstep to attempt to heal it through non-creative agents.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not follow, however, that the use of such agents for corrective purposes is evil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Sometimes the illness has a sufficiently strong hold over the mind to render a person temporarily inaccessible to the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In this case it may be wise to utilize a compromise approach to mind and body, in which something from the outside is temporarily given healing belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is because the last thing that can help the non-right-minded, or the sick, is an increase in fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They are already in a fear-weakened state.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If they are prematurely exposed to a miracle, they may be precipitated into panic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This is likely to occur when upside-down perception has induced the belief that miracles are frightening.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"064#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The value of the Atonement does not lie in the manner in which it is expressed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In fact, if it is used truly, it will inevitably be expressed in whatever way is most helpful to the receiver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This means that a miracle, to attain its full efficacy, must be expressed in a language that the recipient can understand without fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This does not necessarily mean that this is the highest level of communication of which he is capable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It does mean, however, that it is the highest level of communication of which he is capable <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"064#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The whole aim of the miracle is to raise the level of communication, not to lower it by increasing fear.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Our emphasis is now on healing.
