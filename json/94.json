class=\"acim-text chap-5-sect-6\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God in His knowledge is not waiting, but His Kingdom is bereft while <i>you</i> wait.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All the Sons of God are waiting for your return, just as you are waiting for theirs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Delay does not matter in eternity, but it is tragic in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have elected to be in time rather than eternity, and therefore believe you <i>are</i> in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet your election is both free and alterable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not belong in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your place is only in eternity, where God Himself placed you forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Guilt feelings are the preservers of time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They induce fears of retaliation or abandonment, and thus ensure that the future will be like the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the ego’s continuity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It gives the ego a false sense of security by believing that you cannot escape from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But you can and must.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God offers you the continuity of eternity in exchange.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When you choose to make this exchange, you will simultaneously exchange guilt for joy, viciousness for love, and pain for peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>My role is only to unchain your will and set it free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your ego cannot accept this freedom, and will oppose it at every possible moment and in every possible way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And as its maker, you recognize what it can do because you gave it the power to do it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember the Kingdom always, and remember that you who are part of the Kingdom cannot be lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Mind that was in me <i>is</i> in you, for God creates with perfect fairness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let the Holy Spirit remind you always of His fairness, and let me teach you how to share it with your brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How else can the chance to claim it for yourself be given you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The two voices speak for different interpretations of the same thing simultaneously; or almost simultaneously, for the ego always speaks first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Alternate interpretations were unnecessary until the first one was made.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego speaks in judgment, and the Holy Spirit reverses its decision, much as a higher court has the power to reverse a lower court’s decisions in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego’s decisions are always wrong, because they are based on the error they were made to uphold.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing the ego perceives is interpreted correctly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Not only does the ego cite Scripture for its purpose, but it even interprets Scripture as a witness for itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Bible is a fearful thing in the ego’s judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perceiving it as frightening, it interprets it fearfully.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Being afraid, you do not appeal to the Higher Court because you believe its judgment would also be against you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There are many examples of how the ego’s interpretations are misleading, but a few will suffice to show how the Holy Spirit can reinterpret them in His Own light.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>“As ye sow, so shall ye reap” He interprets to mean what you consider worth cultivating you will cultivate in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your judgment of what is worthy makes it worthy for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>“Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord” is easily reinterpreted if you remember that ideas increase only by being shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The statement emphasizes that vengeance cannot be shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Give it therefore to the Holy Spirit, Who will undo it in you because it does not belong in your mind, which is part of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>“I will visit the sins of the fathers unto the third and fourth generation,” as interpreted by the ego, is particularly vicious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It becomes merely an attempt to guarantee the ego’s own survival.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To the Holy Spirit, the statement means that in later generations He can still reinterpret what former generations had misunderstood, and thus release the thoughts from the ability to produce fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>“The wicked shall perish” becomes a statement of Atonement, if the word “perish” is understood as “be undone.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every loveless thought must be undone, a word the ego cannot even understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To the ego, to be undone means to be destroyed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego will not be destroyed because it is part of your thought, but because it is uncreative and therefore unsharing, it will be reinterpreted to release you from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The part of your mind that you have given to the ego will merely return to the Kingdom, where your whole mind belongs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can delay the completion of the Kingdom, but you cannot introduce the concept of fear into it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You need not fear the Higher Court will condemn you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It will merely dismiss the case against you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There can be no case against a child of God, and every witness to guilt in God’s creations is bearing false witness to God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Appeal everything you believe gladly to God’s Own Higher Court, because it speaks for Him and therefore speaks truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It will dismiss the case against you, however carefully you have built it up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The case may be fool-proof, but it is not God-proof.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Holy Spirit will not hear it, because He can only witness truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>His verdict will always be “thine is the Kingdom,” because He was given to you to remind you of what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When I said “I am come as a light into the world,” I meant that I came to share the light with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Remember my reference to the ego’s dark glass, and remember also that I said, “Do not look there.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is still true that where you look to find yourself is up to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your patience with your brother is your patience with yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is not a child of God worth patience?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I have shown you infinite patience because my will is that of our Father, from Whom I learned of infinite patience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His Voice was in me as It is in you, speaking for patience towards the Sonship in the Name of its Creator.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"094#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now you must learn that only infinite patience produces immediate effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the way in which time is exchanged for eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Infinite patience calls upon infinite love, and by producing results <i>now</i> it renders time unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We have repeatedly said that time is a learning device to be abolished when it is no longer useful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit, Who speaks for God in time, also knows that time is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He reminds you of this in every passing moment of time, because it is His special function to return you to eternity and remain to bless your creations there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He is the only blessing you can truly give, because He is truly blessed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"094#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Because He has been given you freely by God, you must give Him as you received Him.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"God in His knowledge is not waiting, but His Kingdom is
