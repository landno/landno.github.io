data-sentence-id=\"145#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each is internally consistent, but they are diametrically opposed in all respects so that partial allegiance is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember, too, that their results are as different as their foundations, and their fundamentally irreconcilable natures cannot be reconciled by vacillations between them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing alive is Fatherless, for life is creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Therefore, your decision is always an answer to the question, “Who is my father?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you will be faithful to the father you choose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"145#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet what would you say to someone who believed this question really involves conflict?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you made the ego, how can the ego have made you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The authority problem is still the only source of conflict, because the ego was made out of the wish of God’s Son to father Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego, then, is nothing more than a delusional system in which you made your own father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Make no mistake about this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It sounds insane when it is stated with perfect honesty, but the ego never looks on what it does with perfect honesty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet that is its insane premise, which is carefully hidden in the dark cornerstone of its thought system.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And either the ego, which you made, <i>is</i> your father, or its whole thought system will not stand.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"145#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You make by projection, but God creates by extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The cornerstone of God’s creation is you, for His thought system is light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember the Rays that are there unseen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The more you approach the center of His thought system, the clearer the light becomes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The closer you come to the foundation of the ego’s thought system, the darker and more obscure becomes the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet even the little spark in your mind is enough to lighten it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Bring this light fearlessly with you, and bravely hold it up to the foundation of the ego’s thought system.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Be willing to judge it with perfect honesty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Open the dark cornerstone of terror on which it rests, and bring it out into the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>There you will see that it rested on meaninglessness, and that everything of which you have been afraid was based on nothing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"145#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span

last looked at the ego’s foundation without shrinking you will also have looked upon ours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I come to you from our Father to offer you everything again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not refuse it in order to keep a dark cornerstone hidden, for its protection will not save you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I give you the lamp and I will go with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will not take this journey alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"145#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I will lead you to your true Father, Who hath need of you, as I have.</span> <span
