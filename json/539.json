data-sentence-id=\"539#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us review the meaning of “forgive,” for it is apt to be distorted and to be perceived as something that entails an unfair sacrifice of righteous wrath, a gift unjustified and undeserved, and a complete denial of the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In such a view, forgiveness must be seen as mere eccentric folly, and this course appear to rest salvation on a whim.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This twisted view of what forgiveness means is easily corrected, when you can accept the fact that pardon is not asked for what is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It must be limited to what is false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is irrelevant to everything except illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Truth is God’s creation, and to pardon that is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All truth belongs to Him, reflects His laws and radiates His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Does this need pardon?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How can you forgive the sinless and eternally benign?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The major difficulty that you find in genuine forgiveness on your part is that you still believe you must forgive the truth, and not illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You conceive of pardon as a vain attempt to look past what is there; to overlook the truth, in an unfounded effort to deceive yourself by making an illusion true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This twisted viewpoint but reflects the hold that the idea of sin retains as yet upon your mind, as you regard yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Because you think your sins are real, you look on pardon as deception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it is impossible to think of sin as true and not believe forgiveness is a lie.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus is forgiveness really but a sin, like all the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It says the truth is false, and smiles on the corrupt as if they were as blameless as the grass; as white as snow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is delusional in what it thinks it can accomplish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It would see as right the plainly wrong; the loathsome as the good.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Pardon is no escape in such a view.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It merely is a further sign that sin is unforgivable, at best to be concealed, denied or called another name, for pardon is a treachery to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Guilt cannot be forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you sin, your guilt is everlasting.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Those who are forgiven from the view their sins are real are pitifully mocked and twice condemned; first, by themselves for what they think they did, and once again by those who pardon them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is sin’s unreality that makes forgiveness natural and wholly sane, a deep relief to those who offer it; a quiet blessing where it is received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not countenance illusions, but collects them lightly, with a little laugh, and gently lays them at the feet of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And there they disappear entirely.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness is the only thing that stands for truth in the illusions of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It sees their nothingness, and looks straight through the thousand forms in which they may appear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It looks on lies, but it is not deceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not heed the self-accusing shrieks of sinners mad with guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It looks on them with quiet eyes, and merely says to them, “My brother, what you think is not the truth.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The strength of pardon is its honesty, which is so uncorrupted that it sees illusions as illusions, not as truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is because of this that it becomes the undeceiver in the face of lies; the great restorer of the simple truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By its ability to overlook what is not there, it opens up the way to truth, which has been blocked by dreams of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now are you free to follow in the way your true forgiveness opens up to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For if one brother has received this gift of you, the door is open to yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a very simple way to find the door to true forgiveness, and perceive it open wide in welcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you feel that you are tempted to accuse someone of sin in any form, do not allow your mind to dwell on what you think he did, for that is self-deception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Ask instead, “Would I accuse myself of doing this?”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus will you see alternatives for choice in terms that render choosing meaningful, and keep your mind as free of guilt and pain as God Himself intended it to be, and as it is in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is but lies that would condemn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In truth is innocence the only thing there is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Forgiveness stands between illusions and the truth; between the world you see and that which lies beyond; between the hell of guilt and Heaven’s gate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Across this bridge, as powerful as love which laid its blessing on it, are all dreams of evil and of hatred and attack brought silently to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are not kept to swell and bluster, and to terrify the foolish dreamer who believes in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has been gently wakened from his dream by understanding what he thought he saw was never there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And now he cannot feel that all escape has been denied to him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He does not have to fight to save himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He does not have to kill the dragons which he thought pursued him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor need he erect the heavy walls of stone and iron doors he thought would make him safe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He can remove the ponderous and useless armor made to chain his mind to fear and misery.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His step is light, and as he lifts his foot to stride ahead a star is left behind, to point the way to those who follow him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness must be practiced, for the world cannot perceive its meaning, nor provide a guide to teach you its beneficence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no thought in all the world that leads to any understanding of the laws it follows, nor the Thought that it reflects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is as alien to the world as is your own reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet it joins your mind with the reality in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we practice true forgiveness, that the time of joining be no more delayed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For we would meet with our reality in freedom and in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Our practicing becomes the footsteps lighting up the way for all our brothers, who will follow us to the reality we share with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That this may be accomplished, let us give a quarter of an hour twice today, and spend it with the Guide Who understands the meaning of forgiveness, and was sent to us to teach it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let us ask of Him:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"539#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let me perceive forgiveness as it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Then choose one brother as He will direct, and catalogue his “sins,” as one by one they cross your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be certain not to dwell on any one of them, but realize that you are using his “offenses” but to save the world from all ideas of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Briefly consider all the evil things you thought of him, and each time ask yourself, “Would I condemn myself for doing this?”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let him be freed from all the thoughts you had of sin in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And now you are prepared for freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you have been practicing thus far in willingness and honesty, you will begin to sense a lifting up, a lightening of weight across your chest, a deep and certain feeling of relief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The time remaining should be given to experiencing the escape from all the heavy chains you sought to lay upon your brother, but were laid upon yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"539#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness should be practiced through the day, for there will still be many times when you forget its meaning and attack yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When this occurs, allow your mind to see through this illusion as you tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"539#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let me perceive forgiveness as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would I accuse myself of doing this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"539#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I will not lay this chain upon myself.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"539#17:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In everything you do remember this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"539#17:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one is crucified alone, and yet no one can enter Heaven by himself.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Let us review the meaning of “forgive,” for it is apt to be distorted and to be perceived as something that entails an unfair sacrifice of righteous
