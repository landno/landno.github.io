data-sentence-id=\"281#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Before your brother’s holiness the world is still, and peace descends on it in gentleness and blessing so complete that not one trace of conflict still remains to haunt you in the darkness of the night.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is your savior from the dreams of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is the healing of your sense of sacrifice and fear that what you have will scatter with the wind and turn to dust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In him is your assurance God is here, and with you now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>While he is what he is, you can be sure that God is knowable and will be known to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For He could never leave His Own creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And the sign that this is so lies in your brother, offered you that all your doubts about yourself may disappear before his holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>See in him God’s creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For in him his Father waits for your acknowledgment that He created you as part of Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Without you there would be a lack in God, a Heaven incomplete, a Son without a Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There could be no universe and no reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what God wills is whole, and part of Him because His Will is One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing alive that is not part of Him, and nothing is but is alive in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your brother’s holiness shows you that God is one with him and you; that what he has is yours because you are not separate from him nor from his Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing is lost to you in all the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothing that God created has He failed to lay before you lovingly, as yours forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And no Thought within His Mind is absent from your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is His Will you share His Love for you, and look upon yourself as lovingly as He conceived of you before the world began, and as He knows you still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God changes not His Mind about His Son with passing circumstance which has no meaning in eternity where He abides, and you with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your brother <i>is</i> as He created him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it is this that saves you from a world that He created not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forget not that the healing of God’s Son is all the world is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is the only purpose the Holy Spirit sees in it, and thus the only one it has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Until you see the healing of the Son as all you wish to be accomplished by the world, by time and all appearances, you will not know the Father nor yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you will use the world for what is not its purpose, and will not escape its laws of violence and death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it is given you to be beyond its laws in all respects, in every way and every circumstance, in all temptation to perceive what is not there, and all belief God’s Son can suffer pain because he sees himself as he is not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Look on your brother, and behold in him the whole reversal of the laws that seem to rule this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>See in his freedom yours, for such it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let not his specialness obscure the truth in him, for not one law of death you bind him to will you escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And not one sin you see in him but keeps you both in hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet will his perfect sinlessness release you both, for holiness is quite impartial, with one judgment made for all it looks upon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And that is made, not of itself, but through the Voice that speaks for God in everything that lives and shares His Being.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is His sinlessness that eyes that see can look upon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is His loveliness they see in everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And it is He they look for everywhere, and find no sight nor place nor time where He is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Within your brother’s holiness, the perfect frame for your salvation and the world’s, is set the shining memory of Him in Whom your brother lives, and you along with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let not your eyes be blinded by the veil of specialness that hides the face of Christ from him, and you as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And let the fear of God no longer hold the vision you were meant to see from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your brother’s body shows not Christ to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He <i>is</i> set forth within his holiness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Choose, then, his body or his holiness as what you want to see, and which you choose is yours to look upon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet will you choose in countless situations, and through time that seems to have no end, until the truth be your decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For eternity is not regained by still one more denial of Christ in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And where is your salvation, if he is but a body?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Where is your peace but in his holiness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And where is God Himself but in that part of Him He set forever in your brother’s holiness, that you might see the truth about yourself, set forth at last in terms you recognized and understood?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your brother’s holiness is sacrament and benediction unto you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His errors cannot withhold God’s blessing from himself, nor you who see him truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His mistakes can cause delay, which it is given you to take from him, that both may end a journey that has never begun, and needs no end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What never was is not a part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you will think it is, until you realize that it is not a part of him who stands beside you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is the mirror of yourself, wherein you see the judgment you have laid on both of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Christ in you beholds his holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your specialness looks on his body and beholds him not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>See him as what he is, that your deliverance may not be long.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A senseless wandering, without a purpose and without accomplishment of any kind, is all the other choice can offer you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Futility of function not fulfilled will haunt you while your brother lies asleep, till what has been assigned to you is done and he is risen from the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He who condemned himself, and you as well, is given you to save from condemnation, along with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And both shall see God’s glory in His Son, whom you mistook as flesh, and bound to laws that have no power over him at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you not gladly realize these laws are not for you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Then see him not as prisoner to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It cannot be what governs part of God holds not for all the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You place yourself under the laws you see as ruling him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Think, then, how great the Love of God for you must be, that He has given you a part of Him to save from pain and give you happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And never doubt but that your specialness will disappear before the Will of God, Who loves each part of Him with equal love and care.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Christ in you can see your brother truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Would you decide against the holiness He sees?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Specialness is the function that you gave yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It stands for you alone, as self-created, self-maintained, in need of nothing, and unjoined with anything beyond the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In its eyes you are a separate universe, with all the power to hold itself complete within itself, with every entry shut against intrusion, and every window barred against the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Always attacked and always furious, with anger always fully justified, you have pursued this goal with vigilance you never thought to yield, and effort that you never thought to cease.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And all this grim determination was for this; you wanted specialness to be the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now you are merely asked that you pursue another goal with far less vigilance; with little effort and with little time, and with the power of God maintaining it, and promising success.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet of the two, it is this one you find more difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The “sacrifice” of self you understand, nor do you deem this cost too heavy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But a tiny willingness, a nod to God, a greeting to the Christ in you, you find a burden wearisome and tedious, too heavy to be borne.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet to the dedication to the truth as God established it no sacrifice is asked, no strain called forth, and all the power of Heaven and the might of truth itself is given to provide the means, and guarantee the goal’s accomplishment.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"281#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who believe it easier to see your brother’s body than his holiness, be sure you understand what made this judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is the voice of specialness heard clearly, judging against the Christ and setting forth for you the purpose that you can attain, and what you cannot do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forget not that this judgment must apply to what you do with it as your ally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For what you do through Christ it does not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To Him this judgment makes no sense at all, for only what His Father wills is possible, and there is no alternative for Him to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Out of His lack of conflict comes your peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"281#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And from His purpose comes the means for effortless accomplishment and rest.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Before your brother’s holiness the world is still, and peace descends on it in gentleness and blessing so complete that not one trace of
