data-sentence-id=\"226#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is only the awareness of the body that makes love seem limited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the body <i>is</i> a limit on love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The belief in limited love was its origin, and it was made to limit the unlimited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think not that this is merely allegorical, for it was made to limit <i>you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can you who see yourself within a body know yourself as an idea?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Everything you recognize you identify with externals, something outside itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body cannot know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And while you limit your awareness to its tiny senses, you will not see the grandeur that surrounds you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God cannot come into a body, nor can you join Him there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Limits on love will always seem to shut Him out, and keep you apart from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The body is a tiny fence around a little part of a glorious and complete idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It draws a circle, infinitely small, around a very little segment of Heaven, splintered from the whole, proclaiming that within it is your kingdom, where God can enter not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Within this kingdom the ego rules, and cruelly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And to defend this little speck of dust it bids you fight against the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This fragment of your mind is such a tiny part of it that, could you but appreciate the whole, you would see instantly that it is like the smallest sunbeam to the sun, or like the faintest ripple on the surface of the ocean.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In its amazing arrogance, this tiny sunbeam has decided it is the sun; this almost imperceptible ripple hails itself as the ocean.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Think how alone and frightened is this little thought, this infinitesimal illusion, holding itself apart against the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The sun becomes the sunbeam’s “enemy” that would devour it, and the ocean terrifies the little ripple and wants to swallow it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet neither sun nor ocean is even aware of all this strange and meaningless activity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They merely continue, unaware that they are feared and hated by a tiny segment of themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Even that segment is not lost to them, for it could not survive apart from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what it thinks it is in no way changes its total dependence on them for its being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its whole existence still remains in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Without the sun the sunbeam would be gone; the ripple without the ocean is inconceivable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is the strange position in which those in a world inhabited by bodies seem to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each body seems to house a separate mind, a disconnected thought, living alone and in no way joined to the Thought by which it was created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each tiny fragment seems to be self-contained, needing another for some things, but by no means totally dependent on its one Creator for everything; needing the whole to give it any meaning, for by itself it does mean nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor has it any life apart and by itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Like to the sun and ocean your Self continues, unmindful that this tiny part regards itself as you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not missing; it could not exist if it were separate, nor would the whole be whole without it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not a separate kingdom, ruled by an idea of separation from the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor does a fence surround it, preventing it from joining with the rest, and keeping it apart from its Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This little aspect is no different from the whole, being continuous with it and at one with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It leads no separate life, because its life <i>is</i> the oneness in which its being was created.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not accept this little, fenced-off aspect as yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The sun and ocean are as nothing beside what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The sunbeam sparkles only in the sunlight, and the ripple dances as it rests upon the ocean.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet in neither sun nor ocean is the power that rests in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would you remain within your tiny kingdom, a sorry king, a bitter ruler of all that he surveys, who looks on nothing yet who would still die to defend it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This little self is not your kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Arched high above it and surrounding it with love is the glorious whole, which offers all its happiness and deep content to every part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The little aspect that you think you set apart is no exception.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Love knows no bodies, and reaches to everything created like itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its total lack of limit <i>is</i> its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is completely impartial in its giving, encompassing only to preserve and keep complete what it would give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In your tiny kingdom you have so little!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Should it not, then, be there that you would call on love to enter?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Look at the desert—dry and unproductive, scorched and joyless—that makes up your little kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And realize the life and joy that love would bring to it from where it comes, and where it would return with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Thought of God surrounds your little kingdom, waiting at the barrier you built to come inside and shine upon the barren ground.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>See how life springs up everywhere!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The desert becomes a garden, green and deep and quiet, offering rest to those who lost their way and wander in the dust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Give them a place of refuge, prepared by love for them where once a desert was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And everyone you welcome will bring love with him from Heaven for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They enter one by one into this holy place, but they will not depart as they had come, alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The love they brought with them will stay with them, as it will stay with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And under its beneficence your little garden will expand, and reach out to everyone who thirsts for living water, but has grown too weary to go on alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Go out and find them, for they bring your Self with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And lead them gently to your quiet garden, and receive their blessing there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>So will it grow and stretch across the desert, leaving no lonely little kingdoms locked away from love, and leaving you inside.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will recognize yourself, and see your little garden gently transformed into the Kingdom of Heaven, with all the Love of its Creator shining upon it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant is your invitation to love to enter into your bleak and joyless kingdom, and to transform it into a garden of peace and welcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love’s answer is inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It will come because you came without the body, and interposed no barriers to interfere with its glad coming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the holy instant, you ask of love only what it offers everyone, neither less nor more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Asking for everything, you will receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And your shining Self will lift the tiny aspect that you tried to hide from Heaven straight to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No part of love calls on the whole in vain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No Son of God remains outside His Fatherhood.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be sure of this; love has entered your special relationship, and entered fully at your weak request.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not recognize that love has come, because you have not yet let go of all the barriers you hold against your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you and he will not be able to give love welcome separately.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You could no more know God alone than He knows you without your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But together you could no more be unaware of love than love could know you not, or fail to recognize itself in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"226#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have reached the end of an ancient journey, not realizing yet that it is over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are still worn and tired, and the desert’s dust still seems to cloud your eyes and keep you sightless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet He Whom you welcomed has come to you, and would welcome you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has waited long to give you this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Receive it now of Him, for He would have you know Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only a little wall of dust still stands between you and your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Blow on it lightly and with happy laughter, and it will fall away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"226#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And walk into the garden love has prepared for both of you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is only the awareness of the body that makes love seem limited.
