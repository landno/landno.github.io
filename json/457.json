thoughts, which share everything with everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"457#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As my thoughts of separation call to the separation thoughts of others, so my real thoughts awaken the real thoughts in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"457#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And the world my real thoughts show me will dawn on their sight as well as
