data-sentence-id=\"220#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Does not a world that seems quite real arise in dreams?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet think what this world is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is clearly not the world you saw before you slept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Rather it is a distortion of the world, planned solely around what you would have preferred.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here, you are “free” to make over whatever seemed to attack you, and change it into a tribute to your ego, which was outraged by the “attack.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This would not be your wish unless you saw yourself as one with the ego, which always looks upon itself, and therefore on you, as under attack and highly vulnerable to it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"220#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Dreams are chaotic because they are governed by your conflicting wishes, and therefore they have no concern with what is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are the best example you could have of how perception can be utilized to substitute illusions for truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not take them seriously on awaking because the fact that reality is so outrageously violated in them becomes apparent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet they are a way of looking at the world, and changing it to suit the ego better.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They provide striking examples, both of the ego’s inability to tolerate reality, and of your willingness to change reality on its behalf.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"220#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not find the differences between what you see in sleep and on awaking disturbing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You recognize that what you see on waking is blotted out in dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet on awakening, you do not expect it to be gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In dreams <i>you</i> arrange everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>People become what you would have them be, and what they do you order.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No limits on substitution are laid upon you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For a time it seems as if the world were given you, to make it what you wish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You do not realize you are attacking it, trying to triumph over it and make it serve you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"220#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Dreams are perceptual temper tantrums, in which you literally scream, “I want it thus!”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And thus it seems to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And yet the dream cannot escape its origin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Anger and fear pervade it, and in an instant the illusion of satisfaction is invaded by the illusion of terror.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the dream of your ability to control reality by substituting a world that you prefer <i>is</i> terrifying.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your attempts to blot out reality are very fearful, but this you are not willing to accept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so you substitute the fantasy that reality is fearful, not what you would do to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And thus is guilt made real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"220#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Dreams show you that you have the power to make a world as you would have it be, and that because you want it you see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And while you see it you do not doubt that it is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet here is a world, clearly within your mind, that seems to be outside.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do not respond to it as though you made it, nor do you realize that the emotions the dream produces must come from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the figures in the dream and what they do that seem to make the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not realize that you are making them act out for you, for if you did the guilt would not be theirs, and the illusion of satisfaction would be gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In dreams these features are not obscure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You seem to waken, and the dream is gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet what you fail to recognize is that what caused the dream has not gone with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Your wish to make another world that is not real remains with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And what you seem to waken to is but another form of this same world you see in dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>All your time is spent in dreaming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Your sleeping and your waking dreams have different forms, and that is all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>Their content is the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>They are your protest against reality, and your fixed and insane idea that you can change it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:16\"><span class=\"snr\">16</span>In your waking dreams, the special relationship has a special place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:17\"><span class=\"snr\">17</span>It is the means by which you try to make your sleeping dreams come true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:18\"><span class=\"snr\">18</span>From this, you do not waken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:19\"><span class=\"snr\">19</span>The special relationship is your determination to keep your hold on unreality, and to prevent yourself from waking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#5:20\"><span class=\"snr\">20</span>And while you see more value in sleeping than in waking, you will not let go of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"220#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit, ever practical in His wisdom, accepts your dreams and uses them as means for waking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You would have used them to remain asleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I said before that the first change, before dreams disappear, is that your dreams of fear are changed to happy dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is what the Holy Spirit does in the special relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He does not destroy it, nor snatch it away from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But He does use it differently, as a help to make His purpose real to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The special relationship will remain, not as a source of pain and guilt, but as a source of joy and freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It will not be for you alone, for therein lay its misery.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>As its unholiness kept it a thing apart, its holiness will become an offering to everyone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"220#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your special relationship will be a means for undoing guilt in everyone blessed through your holy relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It will be a happy dream, and one which you will share with all who come within your sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Through it, the blessing the Holy Spirit has laid upon it will be extended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think not that He has forgotten anyone in the purpose He has given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And think not that He has forgotten you to whom He gave the gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He uses everyone who calls on Him as means for the salvation of everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And He will waken everyone through you who offered your relationship to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you but recognized His gratitude!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Or mine through His!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For we are joined as in one purpose, being of one mind with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"220#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let not the dream take hold to close your eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not strange that dreams can make a world that is unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the <i>wish</i> to make it that is incredible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your relationship with your brother has now become one in which the wish has been removed, because its purpose has been changed from one of dreams to one of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are not sure of this because you think it may be this that is the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are so used to choosing among dreams you do not see that you have made, at last, the choice between the truth and <i>all</i> illusions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"220#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet Heaven is sure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is no dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its coming means that you have chosen truth, and it has come because you have been willing to let your special relationship meet its conditions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In your relationship the Holy Spirit has gently laid the real world; the world of happy dreams, from which awaking is so easy and so natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For as your sleeping and your waking dreams represent the same wishes in your mind, so do the real world and the truth of Heaven join in the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The dream of waking is easily transferred to its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For this dream reflects your will joined with the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"220#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And what this Will would have accomplished has never <i>not</i> been done.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Does not a world that seems
