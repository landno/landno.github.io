data-sentence-id=\"304#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What, then, remains to be undone for you to realize Their Presence?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only this; you have a differential view of when attack is justified, and when you think it is unfair and not to be allowed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you perceive it as unfair, you think that a response of anger now is just.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thus you see what is the same as different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Confusion is not limited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it occurs at all it will be total.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And its presence, in whatever form, will hide Their Presence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They are known with clarity or not at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Confused perception will block knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is not a question of the size of the confusion, or how much it interferes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Its simple presence shuts the door to Theirs, and keeps Them there unknown.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"304#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What does it mean if you perceive attack in certain forms to be unfair to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It means that there must be some forms in which you think it fair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For otherwise, how could some be evaluated as unfair?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Some, then, are given meaning and perceived as sensible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And only some are seen as meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And this denies the fact that <i>all</i> are senseless, equally without a cause or consequence, and cannot have effects of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Their Presence is obscured by any veil that stands between Their shining innocence, and your awareness that it is your own and equally belongs to every living thing along with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God limits not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And what is limited cannot be Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>So it must be hell.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"304#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Unfairness and attack are one mistake, so firmly joined that where one is perceived the other must be seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot be unfairly treated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The belief you are is but another form of the idea you are deprived by someone not yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Projection of the cause of sacrifice is at the root of everything perceived to be unfair and not your just deserts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it is you who ask this of yourself, in deep injustice to the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have no enemy except yourself, and you are enemy indeed to him because you do not know him <i>as</i> yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What could be more unjust than that he be deprived of what he is, denied the right to be himself, and asked to sacrifice his Father’s Love and yours as not his due?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"304#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Beware of the temptation to perceive yourself unfairly treated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this view, you seek to find an innocence that is not Theirs but yours alone, and at the cost of someone else’s guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Can innocence be purchased by the giving of your guilt to someone else?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And <i>is</i> it innocence that your attack on him attempts to get?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is it not retribution for your own attack upon the Son of God you seek?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Is it not safer to believe that you are innocent of this, and victimized despite your innocence?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Whatever way the game of guilt is played, there must be loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Someone must lose his innocence that someone else can take it from him, making it his own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"304#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You think your brother is unfair to you because you think that one must be unfair to make the other innocent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And in this game do you perceive one purpose for your whole relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this you seek to add unto the purpose given it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit’s purpose is to let the Presence of your holy Guests be known to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And to this purpose nothing can be added, for the world is purposeless except for this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To add or take away from this one goal is but to take away all purpose from the world and from yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And each unfairness that the world appears to lay upon you, you have laid on it by rendering it purposeless, without the function that the Holy Spirit sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And simple justice has been thus denied to every living thing upon the earth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"304#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What this injustice does to you who judge unfairly, and who see as you have judged, you cannot calculate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world grows dim and threatening, not a trace of all the happy sparkle that salvation brings can you perceive to lighten up your way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so you see yourself deprived of light, abandoned to the dark, unfairly left without a purpose in a futile world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The world is fair because the Holy Spirit has brought injustice to the light within, and there has all unfairness been resolved and been replaced with justice and with love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you perceive injustice anywhere, you need but say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"304#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>By this do I deny the Presence of the Father and the Son.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"304#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And I would rather know of Them than see injustice, which Their Presence shines away.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"What, then, remains to be undone for you to realize Their Presence?
