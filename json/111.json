Mind","inlineNumber":"V."},"annotation":"T-7.V","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-7-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body is nothing more than a framework for developing abilities, which is quite apart from what they are used for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span><i>That</i> is a decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The effects of the ego’s decision in this matter are so apparent that they need no elaboration, but the Holy Spirit’s decision to use the body only for communication has such a direct connection with healing that it does need clarification.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The unhealed healer obviously does not understand his own vocation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only minds communicate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Since the ego cannot obliterate the impulse to communicate because it is also the impulse to create, it can only teach you that the body can both communicate and create, and therefore does not need the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego thus tries to teach you that the body can act like the mind, and is therefore self-sufficient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet we have learned that behavior is not the level for either teaching or learning, since you can act in accordance with what you do not believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To do this, however, will weaken you as a teacher and a learner because, as has been repeatedly emphasized, you teach what you <i>do</i> believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>An inconsistent lesson will be poorly taught and poorly learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you teach both sickness <i>and</i> healing, you are both a poor teacher and a poor learner.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing is the one ability everyone can develop and must develop if he is to be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Healing is the Holy Spirit’s form of communication in this world, and the only one He accepts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He recognizes no other, because He does not accept the ego’s confusion of mind and body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Minds can communicate, but they cannot hurt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The body in the service of the ego can hurt other bodies, but this cannot occur unless the body has already been confused with the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This situation, too, can be used either for healing or for magic, but you must remember that magic always involves the belief that healing is harmful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This belief is its totally insane premise, and so it proceeds accordingly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing only strengthens.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Magic always tries to weaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Healing perceives nothing in the healer that everyone else does not share with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Magic always sees something “special” in the healer, which he believes he can offer as a gift to someone who does not have it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He may believe that the gift comes from God to him, but it is quite evident that he does not understand God if he thinks he has something that others lack.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit does not work by chance, and healing that is of Him <i>always</i> works.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Unless the healer always heals by Him the results will vary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet healing itself is consistent, since only consistency is conflict-free, and only the conflict-free are whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By accepting exceptions and acknowledging that he can sometimes heal and sometimes not, the healer is obviously accepting inconsistency.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is therefore in conflict, and is teaching conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can anything of God not be for all and for always?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Love is incapable of any exceptions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Only if there is fear does the idea of exceptions seem to be meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Exceptions are fearful because they are made by fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The “fearful healer” is a contradiction in terms, and is therefore a concept that only a conflicted mind could possibly perceive as meaningful.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Fear does not gladden.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Healing does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fear always makes exceptions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Healing never does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Fear produces dissociation, because it induces separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Healing always produces harmony, because it proceeds from integration.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is predictable because it can be counted on.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Everything that is of God can be counted on, because everything of God is wholly real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Healing can be counted on because it is inspired by His Voice, and is in accord with His laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet if healing is consistent it cannot be inconsistently understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Understanding means consistency because God means consistency.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Since that is His meaning, it is also yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Your meaning cannot be out of accord with His, because your whole meaning and your only meaning comes from His and is like His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>God cannot be out of accord with Himself, and you cannot be out of accord with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#6:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>You cannot separate your Self from your Creator, Who created you by sharing His Being with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The unhealed healer wants gratitude from his brothers, but he is not grateful to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is because he thinks he is giving something to them, and is not receiving something equally desirable in return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His teaching is limited because he is learning so little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His healing lesson is limited by his own ingratitude, which is a lesson in sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>True learning is constant, and so vital in its power for change that a Son of God can recognize his power in one instant and change the world in the next.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is because, by changing his mind, he has changed the most powerful device that was ever given him for change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This in no way contradicts the changelessness of mind as God created it, but you think that you have changed it as long as you learn through the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This places you in a position of needing to learn a lesson that seems contradictory;—you must learn to change your mind about your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Only by this can you learn that it <i>is</i> changeless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you heal, that is exactly what you <i>are</i> learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are recognizing the changeless mind in your brother by realizing that he could not have changed his mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is how you perceive the Holy Spirit in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is only the Holy Spirit in him that never changes His Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He himself may think he can, or he would not perceive himself as sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He therefore does not know what his Self is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you see only the changeless in him you have not really changed him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>By changing your mind about his <i>for</i> him, you help him undo the change his ego thinks it has made in him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As you can hear two voices, so you can see in two ways.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>One way shows you an image, or an idol that you may worship out of fear, but will never love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The other shows you only truth, which you will love because you will understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Understanding is appreciation, because what you understand you can identify with, and by making it part of you, you have accepted it with love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is how God Himself created you; in understanding, in appreciation and in love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego is totally unable to understand this, because it does not understand what it makes, does not appreciate it and does not love it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It incorporates to take away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It literally believes that every time it deprives someone of something, it has increased.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I have spoken often of the increase of the Kingdom by your creations, which can only be created as you were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The whole glory and perfect joy that <i>is</i> the Kingdom lies in you to give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Do you not want to give it?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot forget the Father because I am with you, and I cannot forget Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To forget me is to forget yourself and Him Who created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Our brothers are forgetful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is why they need your remembrance of me and of Him Who created me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Through this remembrance, you can change their minds about themselves, as I can change yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your mind is so powerful a light that you can look into theirs and enlighten them, as I can enlighten yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I do not want to share my body in communion because this is to share nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Would I try to share an illusion with the most holy children of a most holy Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet I do want to share my mind with you because we are of one Mind, and that Mind is ours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>See only this Mind everywhere, because only this is everywhere and in everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It is everything because it encompasses all things within itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#10:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Blessed are you who perceive only this, because you perceive only what is true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"111#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Come therefore unto me, and learn of the truth in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The mind we share is shared by all our brothers, and as we see them truly they will be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let your mind shine with mine upon their minds, and by our gratitude to them make them aware of the light in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This light will shine back upon you and on the whole Sonship, because this is your proper gift to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He will accept it and give it to the Sonship, because it is acceptable to Him and therefore to His Sons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is true communion with the Holy Spirit, Who sees the altar of God in everyone, and by bringing it to your appreciation, He calls upon you to love God and His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You can appreciate the Sonship only as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"111#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is part of the law of creation, and therefore governs all thought.</span></p></div>
