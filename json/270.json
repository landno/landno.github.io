data-sentence-id=\"270#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The memory of God comes to the quiet mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It cannot come where there is conflict, for a mind at war against itself remembers not eternal gentleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The means of war are not the means of peace, and what the warlike would remember is not love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>War is impossible unless belief in victory is cherished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Conflict within you must imply that you believe the ego has the power to be victorious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Why else would you identify with it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Surely you realize the ego is at war with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Certain it is it has no enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet just as certain is its fixed belief it has an enemy that it must overcome and will succeed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do you not realize a war against yourself would be a war on God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is victory conceivable?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And if it were, is this a victory that you would want?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The death of God, if it were possible, would be your death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is this a victory?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego always marches to defeat, because it thinks that triumph over you is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And God thinks otherwise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is no war; only the mad belief the Will of God can be attacked and overthrown.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You may identify with this belief, but never will it be more than madness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And fear will reign in madness, and will seem to have replaced love there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This is the conflict’s purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And to those who think that it is possible, the means seem real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be certain that it is impossible God and the ego, or yourself and it, will ever meet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You seem to meet, and make your strange alliances on grounds that have no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For your beliefs converge upon the body, the ego’s chosen home, which you believe is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You meet at a mistake; an error in your self-appraisal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego joins with an illusion of yourself you share with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And yet illusions cannot join.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are the same, and they are nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Their joining lies in nothingness; two are as meaningless as one or as a thousand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The ego joins with nothing, being nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The victory it seeks is meaningless as is itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Brother, the war against yourself is almost over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The journey’s end is at the place of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you not now accept the peace offered you here?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This “enemy” you fought as an intruder on your peace is here transformed, before your sight, into the giver of your peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your “enemy” was God Himself, to Whom all conflict, triumph and attack of any kind are all unknown.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He loves you perfectly, completely and eternally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Son of God at war with his Creator is a condition as ridiculous as nature roaring at the wind in anger, proclaiming it is part of itself no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Could nature possibly establish this, and make it true?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nor is it up to you to say what shall be part of you and what is kept apart.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The war against yourself was undertaken to teach the Son of God that he is not himself, and <i>not</i> his Father’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this, the memory of his Father must be forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It <i>is</i> forgotten in the body’s life, and if you think you are a body, you will believe you have forgotten it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet truth can never be forgotten by itself, and you have not forgotten what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only a strange illusion of yourself, a wish to triumph over what you are, remembers not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The war against yourself is but the battle of two illusions, struggling to make them different from each other, in the belief the one that conquers will be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There <i>is</i> no conflict between them and the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor are they different from each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Both are not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so it matters not what form they take.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What made them is insane, and they remain part of what made them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Madness holds out no menace to reality, and has no influence upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Illusions cannot triumph over truth, nor can they threaten it in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And the reality that they deny is not a part of them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What <i>you</i> remember <i>is</i> a part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you must be as God created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Truth does not fight against illusions, nor do illusions fight against the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Illusions battle only with themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Being fragmented, they fragment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But truth is indivisible, and far beyond their little reach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You will remember what you know when you have learned you cannot be in conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>One illusion about yourself can battle with another, yet the war of two illusions is a state where nothing happens.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There is no victor and there is no victory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And truth stands radiant, apart from conflict, untouched and quiet in the peace of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Conflict must be between two forces.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It cannot exist between one power and nothingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is nothing you could attack that is not part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And <i>by</i> attacking it you make two illusions of yourself, in conflict with each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this occurs whenever you look on anything that God created with anything but love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Conflict is fearful, for it is the birth of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet what is born of nothing cannot win reality through battle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Why would you fill your world with conflicts with yourself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let all this madness be undone for you, and turn in peace to the rememberance of God, still shining in your quiet mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>See how the conflict of illusions disappears when it is brought to truth!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it seems real only as long as it is seen as war between conflicting truths; the conqueror to be the truer, the more real, and the vanquisher of the illusion that was less real, made an illusion by defeat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus, conflict is the choice between illusions, one to be crowned as real, the other vanquished and despised.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here will the Father never be remembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet no illusion can invade His home and drive Him out of what He loves forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what He loves must be forever quiet and at peace <i>because</i> it is His home.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who are beloved of Him are no illusion, being as true and holy as Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The stillness of your certainty of Him and of yourself is home to Both of You, Who dwell as one and not apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Open the door of His most holy home, and let forgiveness sweep away all trace of the belief in sin that keeps God homeless and His Son with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are not a stranger in the house of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Welcome your brother to the home where God has set him in serenity and peace, and dwells with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Illusions have no place where love abides, protecting you from everything that is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You dwell in peace as limitless as its Creator, and everything is given those who would remember Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Over His home the Holy Spirit watches, sure that its peace can never be disturbed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can the resting place of God turn on itself, and seek to overcome the One Who dwells there?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And think what happens when the house of God perceives itself divided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The altar disappears, the light grows dim, the temple of the Holy One becomes a house of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And nothing is remembered except illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Illusions can conflict, because their forms are different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And they do battle only to establish which form is true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"270#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Illusion meets illusion; truth, itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The meeting of illusions leads to war.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Peace, looking on itself, extends itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>War is the condition in which fear is born, and grows and seeks to dominate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Peace is the state where love abides, and seeks to share itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Conflict and peace are opposites.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Where one abides the other cannot be; where either goes the other disappears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>So is the memory of God obscured in minds that have become illusions’ battleground.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"270#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet far beyond this senseless war it shines, ready to be remembered when you side with peace.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The
