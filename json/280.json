data-sentence-id=\"280#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Christ in you is very still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He looks on what He loves, and knows it as Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus does He rejoice at what He sees, because He knows that it is one with Him and with His Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Specialness, too, takes joy in what it sees, although it is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet what you seek for is a source of joy as you conceive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What you wish is true for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor is it possible that you can wish for something and lack faith that it is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Wishing makes real, as surely as does will create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The power of a wish upholds illusions as strongly as does love extend itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Except that one deludes; the other heals.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"280#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no dream of specialness, however hidden or disguised the form, however lovely it may seem to be, however much it delicately offers the hope of peace and the escape from pain, in which you suffer not your condemnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In dreams effect and cause are interchanged, for here the maker of the dream believes that what he made is happening to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He does not realize he picked a thread from here, a scrap from there, and wove a picture out of nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the parts do not belong together, and the whole contributes nothing to the parts to give them meaning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"280#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Where could your peace arise <i>but</i> from forgiveness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Christ in you looks only on the truth, and sees no condemnation that could need forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is at peace <i>because</i> He sees no sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Identify with Him, and what has He that you have not?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is your eyes, your ears, your hands, your feet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How gentle are the sights He sees, the sounds He hears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How beautiful His hand that holds His brother’s, and how lovingly He walks beside him, showing him what can be seen and heard, and where he will see nothing and there is no sound to hear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"280#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet let your specialness direct his way, and you will follow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And both will walk in danger, each intent, in the dark forest of the sightless, unlit but by the shifting tiny gleams that spark an instant from the fireflies of sin and then go out, to lead the other to a nameless precipice and hurl him over it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what can specialness delight in but to kill?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What does it seek for but the sight of death?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Where does it lead but to destruction?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet think not that it looked upon your brother first, nor hated him before it hated you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The sin its eyes behold in him and love to look upon it saw in you, and looks on still with joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet is it joy to look upon decay and madness, and believe this crumbling thing, with flesh already loosened from the bone and sightless holes for eyes, is like yourself?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"280#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Rejoice you have no eyes with which to see; no ears to listen, and no hands to hold nor feet to guide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be glad that only Christ can lend you His, while you have need of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are illusions, too, as much as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet because they serve a different purpose, the strength their purpose holds is given them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what they see and hear and hold and lead is given light, that you may lead as you were led.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"280#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

knows where you are going, and He leads you there in gentleness and blessing all the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Love for God replaces all the fear you thought you saw within yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His Holiness shows you Himself in him whose hand you hold, and whom you lead to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what you see is like yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For what but Christ is there to see and hear and love and follow home?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He looked upon you first, but recognized that you were not complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so He sought for your completion in each living thing that He beholds and loves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And seeks it still, that each might offer you the Love of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"280#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet is He quiet, for He knows that love is in you now, and safely held in you by that same hand that holds your brother’s in your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Christ’s hand holds all His brothers in Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He gives them vision for their sightless eyes, and sings to them of Heaven, that their ears may hear no more the sound of battle and of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He reaches through them, holding out His hand, that everyone may bless all living things, and see their holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And He rejoices that these sights are yours, to look upon with Him and share His joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His perfect lack of specialness He offers you, that you may save all living things from death, receiving from each one the gift of life that your forgiveness offers to your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The sight of Christ is all there is to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The song of Christ is all there is to hear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The hand of Christ is all there is to hold.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>There is no journey but to walk with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"280#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who would be content with specialness, and seek salvation in a war with love, consider this: The holy Lord of Heaven has Himself come down to you, to offer you your own completion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What is His is yours because in your completion is His Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He Who willed not to be without His Son could never will that you be brotherless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And would He give a brother unto you except he be as perfect as yourself, and just as like to Him in holiness as you must be?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"280#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There must be doubt before there can be conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And every doubt must be about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Christ has no doubt, and from His certainty His quiet comes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He will exchange His certainty for all your doubts, if you agree that He is One with you, and that this Oneness is endless, timeless, and within your grasp because your hands are His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is within you, yet He walks beside you and before, leading the way that He must go to find Himself complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His quietness becomes your certainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"280#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And where is doubt when certainty has come?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The Christ in you is very still.
