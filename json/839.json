class=\"acim-text manual-24\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"839#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the ultimate sense, reincarnation is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no past or future, and the idea of birth into a body has no meaning either once or many times.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Reincarnation cannot, then, be true in any real sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Our only question should be, “Is the concept helpful?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And that depends, of course, on what it is used for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it is used to strengthen the recognition of the eternal nature of life, it is helpful indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Is any other question about it really useful in lighting up the way?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Like many other beliefs, it can be bitterly misused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>At least, such misuse offers preoccupation and perhaps pride in the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>At worst, it induces inertia in the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>In between, many kinds of folly are possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"839#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Reincarnation would not, under any circumstances, be the problem to be dealt with <i>now</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If it were responsible for some of the difficulties the individual faces now, his task would still be only to escape from them now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If he is laying the groundwork for a future life, he can still work out his salvation only now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To some, there may be comfort in the concept, and if it heartens them its value is self-evident.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is certain, however, that the way to salvation can be found by those who believe in reincarnation and by those who do not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The idea cannot, therefore, be regarded as essential to the curriculum.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is always some risk in seeing the present in terms of the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There is always some good in any thought which strengthens the idea that life and the body are not the same.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"839#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For our purposes, it would not be helpful to take any definite stand on reincarnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A teacher of God should be as helpful to those who believe in it as to those who do not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If a definite stand were required of him, it would merely limit his usefulness, as well as his own decision making.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Our course is not concerned with any concept that is not acceptable to anyone, regardless of his formal beliefs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His ego will be enough for him to cope with, and it is not the part of wisdom to add sectarian controversies to his burdens.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nor would there be an advantage in his premature acceptance of the course merely because it advocates a long-held belief of his own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"839#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It cannot be too strongly emphasized that this course aims at a complete reversal of thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When this is finally accomplished, issues such as the validity of reincarnation become meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Until then, they are likely to be merely controversial.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The teacher of God is, therefore, wise to step away from all such questions, for he has much to teach and learn apart from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He should both learn and teach that theoretical issues but waste time, draining it away from its appointed purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If there are aspects to any concept or belief that will be helpful, he will be told about it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He will also be told how to use it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What more need he know?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"839#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Does this mean that the teacher of God should not believe in reincarnation himself, or discuss it with others who do?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The answer is, certainly not!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If he does believe in reincarnation, it would be a mistake for him to renounce the belief unless his internal Teacher so advised.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And this is most unlikely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He might be advised that he is misusing the belief in some way that is detrimental to his pupil’s advance or his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Reinterpretation would then be recommended, because it is necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All that must be recognized, however, is that birth was not the beginning, and death is not the end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet even this much is not required of the beginner.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He need merely accept the idea that what he knows is not necessarily all there is to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>His journey has begun.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"839#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The emphasis of this course always remains the same;—it is at this moment that complete salvation is offered you, and it is at this moment that you can accept it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is still your one responsibility.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Atonement might be equated with total escape from the past and total lack of interest in the future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Heaven is here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is nowhere else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Heaven is now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no other time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No teaching that does not lead to this is of concern to God’s teachers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>All beliefs will point to this if properly interpreted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>In this sense, it can be said that their truth lies in their usefulness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>All beliefs that lead to progress should be honored.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>This is the sole criterion this course requires.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"839#6:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>No more than this is necessary.</span></p></div>
