data-sentence-id=\"269#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do you not see the opposite of frailty and weakness is sinlessness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Innocence is strength, and nothing else is strong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The sinless cannot fear, for sin of any kind is weakness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The show of strength attack would use to cover frailty conceals it not, for how can the unreal be hidden?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one is strong who has an enemy, and no one can attack unless he thinks he has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Belief in enemies is therefore the belief in weakness, and what is weak is not the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Being opposed to it, it is God’s “enemy.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And God is feared as an opposing will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"269#2\"><p

data-sentence-id=\"269#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will believe that everything you use for sin can hurt you and become your enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you will fight against it, and try to weaken it because of this; and you will think that you succeeded, and attack again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is as certain you will fear what you attack as it is sure that you will love what you perceive as sinless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He walks in peace who travels sinlessly along the way love shows him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For love walks with him there, protecting him from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And he will see only the sinless, who can not attack.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"269#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Walk you in glory, with your head held high, and fear no evil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The innocent are safe because they share their innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing they see is harmful, for their awareness of the truth releases everything from the illusion of harmfulness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what seemed harmful now stands shining in their innocence, released from sin and fear and happily returned to love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They share the strength of love <i>because</i> they looked on innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And every error disappeared because they saw it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who looks for glory finds it where it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Where could it be but in the innocent?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"269#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let not the little interferers pull you to littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There can be no attraction of guilt in innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think what a happy world you walk, with truth beside you!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not give up this world of freedom for a little sigh of seeming sin, nor for a tiny stirring of guilt’s attraction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would you, for all these meaningless distractions, lay Heaven aside?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your destiny and purpose are far beyond them, in the clean place where littleness does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your purpose is at variance with littleness of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so it is at variance with sin.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"269#5\"><p

time intrude upon your sight of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Leave him not frightened and alone in his temptation, but help him rise above it and perceive the light of which he is a part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your innocence will light the way to his, and so is yours protected and kept in your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For who can know his glory, and perceive the little and the weak about him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who can walk trembling in a fearful world, and realize that Heaven’s glory shines on him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"269#6\"><p

data-sentence-id=\"269#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Look on it lovingly, and see the light of Heaven in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>So will you come to understand all that is given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In kind forgiveness will the world sparkle and shine, and everything you once thought sinful now will be reinterpreted as part of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How beautiful it is to walk, clean and redeemed and happy, through a world in bitter need of the redemption that your innocence bestows upon it!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What can you value more than this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For here is your salvation and your freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"269#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And it must be complete if you would recognize it.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Do you not see the opposite of frailty and weakness is sinlessness?
