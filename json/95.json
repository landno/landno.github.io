data-sentence-id=\"095#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do you really believe you can make a voice that can drown out God’s?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do you really believe you can devise a thought system that can separate you from Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do you really believe you can plan for your safety and joy better than He can?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You need be neither careful nor careless; you need merely cast your cares upon Him because He careth for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are His care because He loves you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His Voice reminds you always that all hope is yours because of His care.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You cannot choose to escape His care because that is not His Will, but you can choose to accept His care and use the infinite power of His care for all those He created by it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"095#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There have been many healers who did not heal themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They have not moved mountains by their faith because their faith was not whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Some of them have healed the sick at times, but they have not raised the dead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Unless the healer heals himself, he cannot believe that there is no order of difficulty in miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has not learned that every mind God created is equally worthy of being healed <i>because</i> God created it whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are merely asked to return to God the mind as He created it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He asks you only for what He gave, knowing that this giving will heal you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Sanity is wholeness, and the sanity of your brothers is yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"095#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why should you listen to the endless insane calls you think are made upon you, when you can know the Voice for God is in you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God commended His Spirit to you, and asks that you commend yours to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He wills to keep it in perfect peace, because you are of one mind and spirit with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Excluding yourself from the Atonement is the ego’s last-ditch defense of its own existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It reflects both the ego’s need to separate, and your willingness to side with its separateness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This willingness means that you do not want to be healed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"095#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But the time is now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have not been asked to work out the plan of salvation yourself because, as I told you before, the remedy could not be of your making.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God Himself gave you the perfect Correction for everything you made that is not in accord with His holy Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am making His plan perfectly explicit to you, and will also tell you of your part in it, and how urgent it is to fulfill it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God weeps at the “sacrifice” of His children who believe they are lost to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"095#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you are not wholly joyous, it is because you have reacted with a lack of love to one of God’s creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perceiving this as “sin” you become defensive because you expect attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The decision to react in this way is yours, and can therefore be undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It cannot be undone by repentance in the usual sense, because this implies guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you allow yourself to feel guilty, you will reinforce the error rather than allow it to be undone for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"095#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Decision cannot be difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is obvious, if you realize that you must already have decided not to be wholly joyous if that is how you feel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, the first step in the undoing is to recognize that you actively decided wrongly, but can as actively decide otherwise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Be very firm with yourself in this, and keep yourself fully aware that the undoing process, which does not come from you, is nevertheless within you because God placed it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your part is merely to return your thinking to the point at which the error was made, and give it over to the Atonement in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Say this to yourself as sincerely as you can, remembering that the Holy Spirit will respond fully to your slightest invitation:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I must have decided wrongly, because I am not at peace.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I made the decision myself, but I can also decide otherwise.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I want to decide otherwise, because I want to be at peace.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I do not feel guilty, because the Holy Spirit will undo all the consequences of my wrong decision if I will let Him.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"095#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>I choose to let Him, by allowing Him to decide for God for me.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Do you really believe you can make a
