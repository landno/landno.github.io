class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Knowledge is not the motivation for learning this course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Peace is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the prerequisite for knowledge only because those who are in conflict are not peaceful, and peace is the condition of knowledge because it is the condition of the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Knowledge can be restored only when you meet its conditions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is not a bargain made by God, Who makes no bargains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is merely the result of your misuse of His laws on behalf of an imaginary will that is not His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Knowledge <i>is</i> His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you are opposing His Will, how can you have knowledge?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I have told you what knowledge offers you, but perhaps you do not yet regard this as wholly desirable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If you did you would not be so ready to throw it away when the ego asks for your allegiance.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"119#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The distractions of the ego may seem to interfere with your learning, but the ego has no power to distract you unless you give it the power to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego’s voice is an hallucination.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot expect it to say “I am not real.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you are not asked to dispel your hallucinations alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are merely asked to evaluate them in terms of their results to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you do not want them on the basis of loss of peace, they will be removed from your mind for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"119#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every response to the ego is a call to war, and war does deprive you of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet in this war there is no opponent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the reinterpretation of reality that you must make to secure peace, and the only one you need ever make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Those whom you perceive as opponents are part of your peace, which you are giving up by attacking them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How can you have what you give up?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You share to have, but you do not give it up yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When you give up peace, you are excluding yourself from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is a condition so alien to the Kingdom that you cannot understand the state that prevails within it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"119#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your past learning must have taught you the wrong things, simply because it has not made you happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>On this basis alone its value should be questioned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If learning aims at change, and that is always its purpose, are you satisfied with the changes your learning has brought you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Dissatisfaction with learning outcomes is a sign of learning failure, since it means that you did not get what you wanted.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"119#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The curriculum of the Atonement is the opposite of the curriculum you have established for yourself, but so is its outcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If the outcome of yours has made you unhappy, and if you want a different one, a change in the curriculum is obviously necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The first change to be introduced is a change in direction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A meaningful curriculum cannot be inconsistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If it is planned by two teachers, each believing in diametrically opposed ideas, it cannot be integrated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it is carried out by these two teachers simultaneously, each one merely interferes with the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This leads to fluctuation, but not to change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The volatile have no direction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>They cannot choose one because they cannot relinquish the other, even if it does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Their conflicted curriculum teaches them that <i>all</i> directions exist, and gives them no rationale for choice.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"119#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The total senselessness of such a curriculum must be fully recognized before a real change in direction becomes possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot learn simultaneously from two teachers who are in total disagreement about everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Their joint curriculum presents an impossible learning task.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are teaching you entirely different things in entirely different ways, which might be possible except that both are teaching you about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"119#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your reality is unaffected by both, but if you listen to both, your mind will be split about what your reality is.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Knowledge is not the motivation for learning this course.
