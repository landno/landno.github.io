data-sentence-id=\"540#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who would defend himself unless he thought he were attacked, that the attack were real, and that his own defense could save himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And herein lies the folly of defense; it gives illusions full reality, and then attempts to handle them as real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It adds illusions to illusions, thus making correction doubly difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it is this you do when you attempt to plan the future, activate the past, or organize the present as you wish.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You operate from the belief you must protect yourself from what is happening because it must contain what threatens you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A sense of threat is an acknowledgment of an inherent weakness; a belief that there is danger which has power to call on you to make appropriate defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world is based on this insane belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And all its structures, all its thoughts and doubts, its penalties and heavy armaments, its legal definitions and its codes, its ethics and its leaders and its gods, all serve but to preserve its sense of threat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For no one walks the world in armature but must have terror striking at his heart.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Defense is frightening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It stems from fear, increasing fear as each defense is made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You think it offers safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it speaks of fear made real and terror justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is it not strange you do not pause to ask, as you elaborate your plans and make your armor thicker and your locks more tight, what you defend, and how, and against what?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us consider first what you defend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It must be something that is very weak and easily assaulted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It must be something made easy prey, unable to protect itself and needing your defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What but the body has such frailty that constant care and watchful, deep concern are needful to protect its little life?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What but the body falters and must fail to serve the Son of God as worthy host?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet it is not the body that can fear, nor be a thing of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has no needs but those which you assign to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It needs no complicated structures of defense, no health-inducing medicine, no care and no concern at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Defend its life, or give it gifts to make it beautiful or walls to make it safe, and you but say your home is open to the thief of time, corruptible and crumbling, so unsafe it must be guarded with your very life.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is not this picture fearful?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can you be at peace with such a concept of your home?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet what endowed the body with the right to serve you thus except your own belief?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is your mind which gave the body all the functions that you see in it, and set its value far beyond a little pile of dust and water.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who would make defense of something that he recognized as this?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body is in need of no defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This cannot be too often emphasized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It will be strong and healthy if the mind does not abuse it by assigning it to roles it cannot fill, to purposes beyond its scope, and to exalted aims which it cannot accomplish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Such attempts, ridiculous yet deeply cherished, are the sources for the many mad attacks you make upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it seems to fail your hopes, your needs, your values and your dreams.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The “self” that needs protection is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The body, valueless and hardly worth the least defense, need merely be perceived as quite apart from you, and it becomes a healthy, serviceable instrument through which the mind can operate until its usefulness is over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who would want to keep it when its usefulness is done?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Defend the body and you have attacked your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you have seen in it the faults, the weaknesses, the limits and the lacks from which you think the body must be saved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will not see the mind as separate from bodily conditions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will impose upon the body all the pain that comes from the conception of the mind as limited and fragile, and apart from other minds and separate from its Source.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These are the thoughts in need of healing, and the body will respond with health when they have been corrected and replaced with truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the body’s only real defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet is this where you look for its defense?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You offer it protection of a kind from which it gains no benefit at all, but merely adds to your distress of mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not heal, but merely take away the hope of healing, for you fail to see where hope must lie if it be meaningful.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A healed mind does not plan.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It carries out the plans that it receives through listening to wisdom that is not its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It waits until it has been taught what should be done, and then proceeds to do it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not depend upon itself for anything except its adequacy to fulfill the plans assigned to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is secure in certainty that obstacles can not impede its progress to accomplishment of any goal that serves the greater plan established for the good of everyone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A healed mind is relieved of the belief that it must plan, although it cannot know the outcome which is best, the means by which it is achieved, nor how to recognize the problem that the plan is made to solve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It must misuse the body in its plans until it recognizes this is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But when it has accepted this as true, then is it healed, and lets the body go.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Enslavement of the body to the plans the unhealed mind sets up to save itself must make the body sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not free to be the means of helping in a plan which far exceeds its own protection, and which needs its service for a little while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In this capacity is health assured.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For everything the mind employs for this will function flawlessly, and with the strength that has been given it and cannot fail.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is, perhaps, not easy to perceive that self-initiated plans are but defenses, with the purpose all of them were made to realize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are the means by which a frightened mind would undertake its own protection, at the cost of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is not difficult to realize in some forms which these self-deceptions take, where the denial of reality is very obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet planning is not often recognized as a defense.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The mind engaged in planning for itself is occupied in setting up control of future happenings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not think that it will be provided for, unless it makes its own provisions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Time becomes a future emphasis, to be controlled by learning and experience obtained from past events and previous beliefs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It overlooks the present, for it rests on the idea the past has taught enough to let the mind direct its future course.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The mind that plans is thus refusing to allow for change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What it has learned before becomes the basis for its future goals.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its past experience directs its choice of what will happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it does not see that here and now is everything it needs to guarantee a future quite unlike the past, without a continuity of any old ideas and sick beliefs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Anticipation plays no part at all, for present confidence directs the way.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Defenses are the plans you undertake to make against the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Their aim is to select what you approve, and disregard what you consider incompatible with your beliefs of your reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet what remains is meaningless indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For it is your reality that is the “threat” which your defenses would attack, obscure, and take apart and crucify.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#18\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">18.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#18:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What could you not accept, if you but knew that everything that happens, all events, past, present and to come, are gently planned by One Whose only purpose is your good?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#18:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you have misunderstood His plan, for He would never offer pain to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#18:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But your defenses did not let you see His loving blessing shine in every step you ever took.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#18:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>While you made plans for death, He led you gently to eternal life.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#19\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">19.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#19:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your present trust in Him is the defense that promises a future undisturbed, without a trace of sorrow, and with joy that constantly increases, as this life becomes a holy instant, set in time, but heeding only immortality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#19:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let no defenses but your present trust direct the future, and this life becomes a meaningful encounter with the truth that only your defenses would conceal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#20\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">20.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#20:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Without defenses, you become a light which Heaven gratefully acknowledges to be its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#20:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it will lead you on in ways appointed for your happiness according to the ancient plan, begun when time was born.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#20:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your followers will join their light with yours, and it will be increased until the world is lighted up with joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#20:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And gladly will our brothers lay aside their cumbersome defenses, which availed them nothing and could only terrify.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#21\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">21.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#21:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will anticipate that time today with present confidence, for this is part of what was planned for us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#21:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will be sure that everything we need is given us for our accomplishment of this today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#21:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We make no plans for how it will be done, but realize that our defenselessness is all that is required for the truth to dawn upon our minds with certainty.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#22\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">22.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#22:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For fifteen minutes twice today we rest from senseless planning, and from every thought that blocks the truth from entering our minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#22:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today we will receive instead of plan, that we may give instead of organize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#22:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And we are given truly, as we say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"540#22:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If I defend myself I am attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#22:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But in defenselessness I will be strong, and I will learn what my defenses hide.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#23\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">23.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#23:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing but that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#23:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If there are plans to make, you will be told of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#23:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They may not be the plans you thought were needed, nor indeed the answers to the problems which you thought confronted you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#23:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But they are answers to another kind of question, which remains unanswered yet in need of answering until the Answer comes to you at last.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#24\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">24.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#24:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All your defenses have been aimed at not receiving what you will receive today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#24:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And in the light and joy of simple trust, you will but wonder why you ever thought that you must be defended from release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#24:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Heaven asks nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#24:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is hell that makes extravagant demands for sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#24:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You give up nothing in these times today when, undefended, you present yourself to your Creator as you really are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#25\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">25.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#25:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He has remembered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#25:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today we will remember Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#25:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For this is Eastertime in your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#25:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you rise again from what was seeming death and hopelessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#25:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now is the light of hope reborn in you, for now you come without defense, to learn the part for you within the plan of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#25:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What little plans or magical beliefs can still have value, when you have received your function from the Voice for God Himself?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"540#26\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">26.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#26:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Try not to shape this day as you believe would benefit you most.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#26:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you can not conceive of all the happiness that comes to you without your planning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#26:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Learn today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#26:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And all the world will take this giant stride, and celebrate your Eastertime with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#26:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Throughout the day, as foolish little things appear to raise defensiveness in you and tempt you to engage in weaving plans, remind yourself this is a special day for learning, and acknowledge it with this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"540#26:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is my Eastertime.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#26:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And I would keep it holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"540#26:8\"><span
