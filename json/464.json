class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who is the light of the world except God‚Äôs Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This, then, is merely a statement of the truth about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the opposite of a statement of pride, of arrogance, or of self-deception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not describe the self-concept you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It does not refer to any of the characteristics with which you have endowed your idols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It refers to you as you were created by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It simply states the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"464#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To the ego, today‚Äôs idea is the epitome of self-glorification.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But the ego does not understand humility, mistaking it for self-debasement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Humility consists of accepting your role in salvation and in taking no other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not humility to insist you cannot be the light of the world if that is the function God assigned to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is only arrogance that would assert this function cannot be for you, and arrogance is always of the ego.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"464#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>True humility requires that you accept today‚Äôs idea because it is God‚Äôs Voice which tells you it is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is a beginning step in accepting your real function on earth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a giant stride toward taking your rightful place in salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a positive assertion of your right to be saved, and an acknowledgment of the power that is given you to save others.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"464#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will want to think about this idea as often as possible today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the perfect answer to all illusions, and therefore to all temptation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It brings all the images you have made about yourself to the truth, and helps you depart in peace, unburdened and certain of your purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"464#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As many practice periods as possible should be undertaken today, although each one need not exceed a minute or two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They should begin with telling yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"464#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I am the light of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is my only function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is why I am here.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"464#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then think about these statements for a short while, preferably with your eyes closed if the situation permits.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let a few related thoughts come to you, and repeat the idea to yourself if your mind wanders away from the central thought.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"464#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be sure both to begin and end the day with a practice period.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Thus you will awaken with an acknowledgment of the truth about yourself, reinforce it throughout the day, and turn to sleep as you reaffirm your function and your only purpose here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These two practice periods may be longer than the rest, if you find them helpful and want to extend them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"464#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today‚Äôs idea goes far beyond the ego‚Äôs petty views of what you are and what your purpose is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As a bringer of salvation, this is obviously necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the first of a number of giant steps we will take in the next few weeks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Try today to begin to build a firm foundation for these advances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are the light of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"464#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God has built His plan for the salvation of His Son on you.</span></p></div>
