data-sentence-id=\"590#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This world you seem to live in is not home to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And somewhere in your mind you know that this is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A memory of home keeps haunting you, as if there were a place that called you to return, although you do not recognize the voice, nor what it is the voice reminds you of.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet still you feel an alien here, from somewhere all unknown.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothing so definite that you could say with certainty you are an exile here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Just a persistent feeling, sometimes not more than a tiny throb, at other times hardly remembered, actively dismissed, but surely to return to mind again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one but knows whereof we speak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet some try to put by their suffering in games they play to occupy their time, and keep their sadness from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Others will deny that they are sad, and do not recognize their tears at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Still others will maintain that what we speak of is illusion, not to be considered more than but a dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet who, in simple honesty, without defensiveness and self-deception, would deny he understands the words we speak?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We speak today for everyone who walks this world, for he is not at home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He goes uncertainly about in endless search, seeking in darkness what he cannot find; not recognizing what it is he seeks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A thousand homes he makes, yet none contents his restless mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He does not understand he builds in vain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The home he seeks can not be made by him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no substitute for Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All he ever made was hell.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps you think it is your childhood home that you would find again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The childhood of your body, and its place of shelter, are a memory now so distorted that you merely hold a picture of a past that never happened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet there is a Child in you Who seeks His Father’s house, and knows that He is alien here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This childhood is eternal, with an innocence that will endure forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Where this Child shall go is holy ground.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is His Holiness that lights up Heaven, and that brings to earth the pure reflection of the light above, wherein are earth and Heaven joined as one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is this Child in you your Father knows as His Own Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is this Child Who knows His Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He desires to go home so deeply, so unceasingly, His voice cries unto you to let Him rest a while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He does not ask for more than just a few instants of respite; just an interval in which He can return to breathe again the holy air that fills His Father’s house.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are His home as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He will return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But give Him just a little time to be Himself, within the peace that is His home, resting in silence and in peace and love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This Child needs your protection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is far from home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is so little that He seems so easily shut out, His tiny voice so readily obscured, His call for help almost unheard amid the grating sounds and harsh and rasping noises of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet does He know that in you still abides His sure protection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will fail Him not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He will go home, and you along with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This Child is your defenselessness; your strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He trusts in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He came because He knew you would not fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He whispers of His home unceasingly to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For He would bring you back with Him, that He Himself might stay, and not return again where He does not belong, and where He lives an outcast in a world of alien thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His patience has no limits.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He will wait until you hear His gentle Voice within you, calling you to let Him go in peace, along with you, to where He is at home and you with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you are still an instant, when the world recedes from you, when valueless ideas cease to have value in your restless mind, then will you hear His Voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So poignantly He calls to you that you will not resist Him longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In that instant He will take you to His home, and you will stay with Him in perfect stillness, silent and at peace, beyond all words, untouched by fear and doubt, sublimely certain that you are at home.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Rest with Him frequently today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For He was willing to become a little Child that you might learn of Him how strong is he who comes without defenses, offering only love’s messages to those who think he is their enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He holds the might of Heaven in His hand and calls them friend, and gives His strength to them, that they may see He would be Friend to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He asks that they protect Him, for His home is far away, and He will not return to it alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Christ is reborn as but a little Child each time a wanderer would leave his home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For he must learn that what he would protect is but this Child, Who comes defenseless and Who is protected by defenselessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Go home with Him from time to time today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are as much an alien here as He.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Take time today to lay aside your shield which profits nothing, and lay down the spear and sword you raised against an enemy without existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Christ has called you friend and brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has even come to ask your help in letting Him go home today, completed and completely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has come as does a little child, who must beseech his father for protection and for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He rules the universe, and yet He asks unceasingly that you return with Him, and take illusions as your gods no more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"590#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have not lost your innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is for this you yearn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is your heart’s desire.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the voice you hear, and this the call which cannot be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The holy Child remains with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His home is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Today He gives you His defenselessness, and you accept it in exchange for all the toys of battle you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And now the way is open, and the journey has an end in sight at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"590#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Be still an instant and go home with Him, and be at peace a while.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"This world you seem to live in is not home to you.
