data-sentence-id=\"594#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the statement that will one day take all arrogance away from every mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is the thought of true humility, which holds no function as your own but that which has been given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It offers your acceptance of a part assigned to you, without insisting on another role.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not judge your proper role.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It but acknowledges the Will of God is done on earth as well as Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It unites all wills on earth in Heaven’s plan to save the world, restoring it to Heaven’s peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us not fight our function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We did not establish it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not our idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The means are given us by which it will be perfectly accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All that we are asked to do is to accept our part in genuine humility, and not deny with self-deceiving arrogance that we are worthy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What is given us to do, we have the strength to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Our minds are suited perfectly to take the part assigned to us by One Who knows us well.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today’s idea may seem quite sobering, until you see its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All it says is that your Father still remembers you, and offers you the perfect trust He holds in you who are His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It does not ask that you be different in any way from what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What could humility request but this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what could arrogance deny but this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Today we will not shrink from our assignment on the specious grounds that modesty is outraged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is pride that would deny the Call for God Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All false humility we lay aside today, that we may listen to God’s Voice reveal to us what He would have us do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We do not doubt our adequacy for the function He will offer us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will be certain only that He knows our strengths, our wisdom and our holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if He deems us worthy, so we are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is but arrogance that judges otherwise.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is one way, and only one, to be released from the imprisonment your plan to prove the false is true has brought to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Accept the plan you did not make instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Judge not your value to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If God’s Voice assures you that salvation needs your part, and that the whole depends on you, be sure that it is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The arrogant must cling to words, afraid to go beyond them to experience which might affront their stance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet are the humble free to hear the Voice which tells them what they are, and what to do.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Arrogance makes an image of yourself that is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is this image which quails and retreats in terror, as the Voice for God assures you that you have the strength, the wisdom and the holiness to go beyond all images.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are not weak, as is the image of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are not ignorant and helpless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Sin can not tarnish the truth in you, and misery can come not near the holy home of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All this the Voice for God relates to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And as He speaks, the image trembles and seeks to attack the threat it does not know, sensing its basis crumble.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation of the world depends on you, and not upon this little pile of dust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What can it tell the holy Son of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Why need he be concerned with it at all?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And so we find our peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will accept the function God has given us, for all illusions rest upon the weird belief that we can make another for ourselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Our self-made roles are shifting, and they seem to change from mourner to ecstatic bliss of love and loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We can laugh or weep, and greet the day with welcome or with tears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Our very being seems to change as we experience a thousand shifts in mood, and our emotions raise us high indeed, or dash us to the ground in hopelessness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is this the Son of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Could He create such instability and call it Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He Who is changeless shares His attributes with His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All the images His Son appears to make have no effect on what he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They blow across his mind like wind-swept leaves that form a patterning an instant, break apart to group again, and scamper off.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Or like mirages seen above a desert, rising from the dust.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These unsubstantial images will go, and leave your mind unclouded and serene, when you accept the function given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The images you make give rise to but conflicting goals, impermanent and vague, uncertain and ambiguous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who could be constant in his efforts, or direct his energies and concentrated drive toward goals like these?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The functions which the world esteems are so uncertain that they change ten times an hour at their most secure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What hope of gain can rest on goals like this?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In lovely contrast, certain as the sun’s return each morning to dispel the night, your truly given function stands out clear and wholly unambiguous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no doubt of its validity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It comes from One Who knows no error, and His Voice is certain of Its messages.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They will not change, nor be in conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All of them point to one goal, and one you can attain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your plan may be impossible, but God’s can never fail because He is its Source.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do as God’s Voice directs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And if It asks a thing of you which seems impossible, remember Who it is that asks, and who would make denial.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then consider this; which is more likely to be right?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Voice that speaks for the Creator of all things, Who knows all things exactly as they are, or a distorted image of yourself, confused, bewildered, inconsistent and unsure of everything?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let not its voice direct you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Hear instead a certain Voice, which tells you of a function given you by your Creator Who remembers you, and urges that you now remember Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>His gentle Voice is calling from the known to the unknowing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He would comfort you, although He knows no sorrow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He would make a restitution, though He is complete; a gift to you, although He knows that you have everything already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has Thoughts which answer every need His Son perceives, although He sees them not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For Love must give, and what is given in His Name takes on the form most useful in a world of form.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"594#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These are the forms which never can deceive, because they come from Formlessness Itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Forgiveness is an earthly form of love, which as it is in Heaven has no form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet what is needed here is given here as it is needed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In this form you can fulfill your function even here, although what love will mean to you when formlessness has been restored to you is greater still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Salvation of the world depends on you who can forgive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"594#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Such is your function here.</span></p></div>
