Communication","inlineNumber":"VII."},"annotation":"T-4.VII","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-4-sect-7\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"086#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is clear that while the content of any particular ego illusion does not matter, its correction is more helpful in a specific context.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Ego illusions are quite specific, although the mind is naturally abstract.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Part of the mind becomes concrete, however, when it splits.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The concrete part believes in the ego, because the ego depends on the concrete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego is the part of the mind that believes your existence is defined by separation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"086#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everything the ego perceives is a separate whole, without the relationships that imply being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego is thus against communication, except insofar as it is utilized to establish separateness rather than to abolish it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The communication system of the ego is based on its own thought system, as is everything else it dictates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its communication is controlled by its need to protect itself, and it will disrupt communication when it experiences threat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This disruption is a reaction to a specific person or persons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The specificity of the ego’s thinking, then, results in spurious generalization which is really not abstract at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It merely responds in certain specific ways to everything it perceives as related.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"086#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In contrast, spirit reacts in the same way to everything it knows is true, and does not respond at all to anything else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor does it make any attempt to establish what is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It knows that what is true is everything that God created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is in complete and direct communication with every aspect of creation, because it is in complete and direct communication with its Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This communication is the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Creation and communication are synonymous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God created every mind by communicating His Mind to it, thus establishing it forever as a channel for the reception of His Mind and Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Since only beings of a like order can truly communicate, His creations naturally communicate with Him and like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This communication is perfectly abstract, since its quality is universal in application and not subject to any judgment, any exception or any alteration.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God created you by this and for this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The mind can distort its function, but it cannot endow itself with functions it was not given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>That is why the mind cannot totally lose the ability to communicate, even though it may refuse to utilize it on behalf of being.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"086#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Existence as well as being rests on communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Existence, however, is specific in how, what and with whom communication is judged to be worth undertaking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Being is completely without these distinctions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a state in which the mind is in communication with everything that is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To whatever extent you permit this state to be curtailed you are limiting your sense of your own reality, which becomes total only by recognizing all reality in the glorious context of its real relationship to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is your reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not desecrate it or recoil from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is your real home, your real temple and your real Self.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"086#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God, Who encompasses all being, created beings who have everything individually, but who want to share it to increase their joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothing real can be increased except by sharing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is why God created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Divine Abstraction takes joy in sharing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is what creation means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>“How,” “what” and “to whom” are irrelevant, because real creation gives everything, since it can create only like itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Remember that in the Kingdom there is no difference between <i>having</i> and <i>being</i>, as there is in existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In the state of being the mind gives everything always.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"086#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Bible repeatedly states that you should praise God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This hardly means that you should tell Him how wonderful He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has no ego with which to accept such praise, and no perception with which to judge it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But unless you take your part in the creation, His joy is not complete because yours is incomplete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this He does know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He knows it in His Own Being and its experience of His Son’s experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The constant going out of His Love is blocked when His channels are closed, and He is lonely when the minds He created do not communicate fully with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"086#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God has kept your Kingdom for you, but He cannot share His joy with you until you know it with your whole mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Revelation is not enough, because it is only communication <i>from</i> God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God does not need revelation returned to Him, which would clearly be impossible, but He does want it brought to others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This cannot be done with the actual revelation; its content cannot be expressed, because it is intensely personal to the mind that receives it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It can, however, be returned by that mind to other minds, through the attitudes the knowledge from the revelation brings.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"086#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God is praised whenever any mind learns to be wholly helpful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is impossible without being wholly harmless, because the two beliefs must coexist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The truly helpful are invulnerable, because they are not protecting their egos and so nothing can hurt them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Their helpfulness is their praise of God, and He will return their praise of Him because they are like Him, and they can rejoice together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God goes out to them and through them, and there is great joy throughout the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Every mind that is changed adds to this joy with its individual willingness to share in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The truly helpful are God’s miracle workers, whom I direct until we are all united in the joy of the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"086#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I will direct you to wherever you can be truly helpful, and to whoever can follow my guidance through you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is clear that while the
