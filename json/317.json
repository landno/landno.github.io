data-sentence-id=\"317#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What waits in perfect certainty beyond salvation is not our concern.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you have barely started to allow your first, uncertain steps to be directed up the ladder separation led you down.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The miracle alone is your concern at present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here is where we must begin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And having started, will the way be made serene and simple in the rising up to waking and the ending of the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you accept a miracle, you do not add your dream of fear to one that is already being dreamed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Without support, the dream will fade away without effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For it is your support that strengthens it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"317#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No mind is sick until another mind agrees that they are separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And thus it is their joint decision to be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you withhold agreement and accept the part you play in making sickness real, the other mind cannot project its guilt without your aid in letting it perceive itself as separate and apart from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus is the body not perceived as sick by both your minds from separate points of view.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Uniting with a brother’s mind prevents the cause of sickness and perceived effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Healing is the effect of minds that join, as sickness comes from minds that separate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"317#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle does nothing just <i>because</i> the minds are joined, and cannot separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet in the dreaming has this been reversed, and separate minds are seen as bodies, which are separated and which cannot join.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not allow your brother to be sick, for if he is, have you abandoned him to his own dream by sharing it with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has not seen the cause of sickness where it is, and you have overlooked the gap between you, where the sickness has been bred.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus are you joined in sickness, to preserve the little gap unhealed, where sickness is kept carefully protected, cherished, and upheld by firm belief, lest God should come to bridge the little gap that leads to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Fight not His coming with illusions, for it is His coming that you want above all things that seem to glisten in the dream.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"317#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The end of dreaming is the end of fear, and love was never in the world of dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The gap <i>is</i> little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it holds the seeds of pestilence and every form of ill, because it is a wish to keep apart and not to join.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thus it seems to give a cause to sickness which is not its cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The purpose of the gap is all the cause that sickness has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For it was made to keep you separated, in a body which you see as if it were the cause of pain.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"317#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The cause of pain is separation, not the body, which is only its effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet separation is but empty space, enclosing nothing, doing nothing, and as unsubstantial as the empty place between the ripples that a ship has made in passing by.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And covered just as fast, as water rushes in to close the gap, and as the waves in joining cover it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where is the gap between the waves when they have joined, and covered up the space which seemed to keep them separate for a little while?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Where are the grounds for sickness when the minds have joined to close the little gap between them, where the seeds of sickness seemed to grow?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"317#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God builds the bridge, but only in the space left clean and vacant by the miracle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The seeds of sickness and the shame of guilt He cannot bridge, for He can not destroy the alien will that He created not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let its effects be gone and clutch them not with eager hands, to keep them for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle will brush them all aside, and thus make room for Him Who wills to come and bridge His Son’s returning to Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"317#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Count, then, the silver miracles and golden dreams of happiness as all the treasures you would keep within the storehouse of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The door is open, not to thieves, but to your starving brothers, who mistook for gold the shining of a pebble, and who stored a heap of snow that shone like silver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They have nothing left behind the open door.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is the world except a little gap perceived to tear eternity apart, and break it into days and months and years?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what are you who live within the world except a picture of the Son of God in broken pieces, each concealed within a separate and uncertain bit of clay?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"317#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be not afraid, my child, but let your world be gently lit by miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And where the little gap was seen to stand between you and your brother, join him there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so sickness will now be seen without a cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The dream of healing in forgiveness lies, and gently shows you that you never sinned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The miracle would leave no proof of guilt to bring you witness to what never was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in your storehouse it will make a place of welcome for your Father and your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The door is open, that all those may come who would no longer starve, and would enjoy the feast of plenty set before them there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And they will meet with your invited Guests the miracle has asked to come to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"317#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is a feast unlike indeed to those the dreaming of the world has shown.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For here, the more that anyone receives, the more is left for all the rest to share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Guests have brought unlimited supply with Them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And no one is deprived or can deprive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here is a feast the Father lays before His Son, and shares it equally with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in Their sharing there can be no gap in which abundance falters and grows thin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here can the lean years enter not, for time waits not upon this feast, which has no end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"317#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For love has set its table in the space that seemed to keep your Guests apart from you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"What waits in perfect certainty beyond salvation is not our concern.
