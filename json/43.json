class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is how <i>A Course in Miracles</i> begins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#2:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>It makes a fundamental distinction between the real and the unreal; between knowledge and perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#2:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>Knowledge is truth, under one law, the law of love or God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#2:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>Truth is unalterable, eternal and unambiguous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#2:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>It can be unrecognized, but it cannot be changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#2:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>It applies to everything that God created, and only what He created is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#2:7\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">7</span>It is beyond learning because it is beyond time and process.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#2:8\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">8</span>It has no opposite; no beginning and no end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#2:9\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">9</span>It merely is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">3</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world of perception, on the other hand, is the world of time, of change, of beginnings and endings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#3:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>It is based on interpretation, not on facts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#3:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>It is the world of birth and death, founded on the belief in scarcity, loss, separation and death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#3:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>It is learned rather than given, selective in its perceptual emphases, unstable in its functioning, and inaccurate in its interpretations.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">4</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>From knowledge and perception respectively, two distinct thought systems arise which are opposite in every respect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#4:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>In the realm of knowledge no thoughts exist apart from God, because God and His Creation share one Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#4:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>The world of perception, however, is made by the belief in opposites and separate wills, in perpetual conflict with each other and with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#4:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>What perception sees and hears appears to be real because it permits into awareness only what conforms to the wishes of the perceiver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#4:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>This leads to a world of illusions, a world which needs constant defense precisely <i>because</i> it is not real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">5</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have been caught in the world of perception you are caught in a dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#5:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>You cannot escape without help, because everything your senses show merely witnesses to the reality of the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#5:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>God has provided the Answer, the only Way out, the true Helper.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#5:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>It is the function of His Voice, His Holy Spirit, to mediate between the two worlds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#5:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>He can do this because, while on the one hand He knows the truth, on the other He also recognizes our illusions, but without believing in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#5:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>It is the Holy Spirit’s goal to help us escape from the dream world by teaching us how to reverse our thinking and unlearn our mistakes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#5:7\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">7</span>Forgiveness is the Holy Spirit’s great learning aid in bringing this thought reversal about.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#5:8\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">8</span>However, the Course has its own definition of what forgiveness really is just as it defines the world in its own way.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">6</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world we see merely reflects our own internal frame of reference—the dominant ideas, wishes and emotions in our minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#6:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>“Projection makes perception” (<span class=\"reference-link\" data-ref-section-id=\"251\" data-ref-hash=\"1:1\">T-21.in.1:1</span>).</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#6:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>We look inside first, decide the kind of world we want to see and then project that world outside, making it the truth <i>as we see it</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#6:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>We make it true by our interpretations of what it is we are seeing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#6:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>If we are using perception to justify our own mistakes—our anger, our impulses to attack, our lack of love in whatever form it may take—we will see a world of evil, destruction, malice, envy and despair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#6:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>All this we must learn to forgive, not because we are being “good” and “charitable,” but because what we are seeing is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#6:7\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">7</span>We have distorted the world by our twisted defenses, and are therefore seeing what is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#6:8\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">8</span>As we learn to recognize our perceptual errors, we also learn to look past them or “forgive.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#6:9\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">9</span>At the same time we are forgiving ourselves, looking past our distorted self-concepts to the Self That God created in us and as us.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">7</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sin is defined as “lack of love” (<span class=\"reference-link\" data-ref-section-id=\"56\" data-ref-hash=\"3:1\">T-1.IV.3:1</span>).</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#7:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>Since love is all there is, sin in the sight of the Holy Spirit is a mistake to be corrected, rather than an evil to be punished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#7:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>Our sense of inadequacy, weakness and incompletion comes from the strong investment in the “scarcity principle” that governs the whole world of illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#7:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>From that point of view, we seek in others what we feel is wanting in ourselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#7:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>We “love” another in order to get something ourselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#7:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>That, in fact, is what passes for love in the dream world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#7:7\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">7</span>There can be no greater mistake than that, for love is incapable of asking for anything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">8</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only minds can really join, and whom God has joined no man can put asunder (<span class=\"reference-link\" data-ref-section-id=\"212\" data-ref-hash=\"7:3\">T-17.III.7:3</span>).</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#8:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>It is, however, only at the level of Christ Mind that true union is possible, and has, in fact, never been lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#8:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>The “little I” seeks to enhance itself by external approval, external possessions and external “love.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#8:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>The Self That God created needs nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#8:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>It is forever complete, safe, loved and loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#8:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>It seeks to share rather than to get; to extend rather than project.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#8:7\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">7</span>It has no needs and wants to join with others out of their mutual awareness of abundance.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">9</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The special relationships of the world are destructive, selfish and childishly egocentric.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#9:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>Yet, if given to the Holy Spirit, these relationships can become the holiest things on earth—the miracles that point the way to the return to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#9:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>The world uses its special relationships as a final weapon of exclusion and a demonstration of separateness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#9:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>The Holy Spirit transforms them into perfect lessons in forgiveness and in awakening from the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#9:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>Each one is an opportunity to let perceptions be healed and errors corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#9:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>Each one is another chance to forgive oneself by forgiving the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#9:7\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">7</span>And each one becomes still another invitation to the Holy Spirit and to the remembrance of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">10</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perception is a function of the body, and therefore represents a limit on awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#10:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>Perception sees through the body’s eyes and hears through the body’s ears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#10:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>It evokes the limited responses which the body makes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#10:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>The body appears to be largely self-motivated and independent, yet it actually responds only to the intentions of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#10:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>If the mind wants to use it for attack in any form, it becomes prey to sickness, age and decay.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#10:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>If the mind accepts the Holy Spirit’s purpose for it instead, it becomes a useful way of communicating with others, invulnerable as long as it is needed, and to be gently laid by when its use is over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#10:7\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">7</span>Of itself it is neutral, as is everything in the world of perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#10:8\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">8</span>Whether it is used for the goals of the ego or the Holy Spirit depends entirely on what the mind wants.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">11</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The opposite of seeing through the body’s eyes is the vision of Christ, which reflects strength rather than weakness, unity rather than separation, and love rather than fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#11:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>The opposite of hearing through the body’s ears is communication through the Voice for God, the Holy Spirit, which abides in each of us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#11:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>His Voice seems distant and difficult to hear because the ego, which speaks for the little, separated self, seems to be much louder.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#11:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>This is actually reversed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#11:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>The Holy Spirit speaks with unmistakable clarity and overwhelming appeal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#11:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>No one who does not choose to identify with the body could possibly be deaf to His messages of release and hope, nor could he fail to accept joyously the vision of Christ in glad exchange for his miserable picture of himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">12</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Christ’s vision is the Holy Spirit’s gift, God’s alternative to the illusion of separation and to the belief in the reality of sin, guilt and death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#12:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>It is the one correction for all errors of perception; the reconciliation of the seeming opposites on which this world is based.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#12:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>Its kindly light shows all things from another point of view, reflecting the thought system that arises from knowledge and making return to God not only possible but inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#12:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>What was regarded as injustice done to one by someone else now becomes a call for help and for union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#12:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>Sin, sickness and attack are seen as misperceptions calling for remedy through gentleness and love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#12:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>Defenses are laid down because where there is no attack there is no need for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#12:7\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">7</span>Our brothers’ needs become our own, because they are taking the journey with us as we go to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#12:8\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">8</span>Without us they would lose their way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#12:9\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">9</span>Without them we could never find our own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">13</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness is unknown in Heaven, where the need for it would be inconceivable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#13:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>However, in this world, forgiveness is a necessary correction for all the mistakes that we have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#13:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>To offer forgiveness is the only way for us to have it, for it reflects the law of Heaven that giving and receiving are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#13:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>Heaven is the natural state of all the Sons of God as He created them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#13:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>Such is their reality forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#13:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>It has not changed because it has been forgotten.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"043#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr noprint\">14</span><span data-sentence-id=\"043#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness is the means by which we will remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#14:2\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">2</span>Through forgiveness the thinking of the world is reversed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#14:3\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">3</span>The forgiven world becomes the gate of Heaven, because by its mercy we can at last forgive ourselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#14:4\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">4</span>Holding no one prisoner to guilt, we become free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#14:5\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">5</span>Acknowledging Christ in all our brothers, we recognize His Presence in ourselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#14:6\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">6</span>Forgetting all our misperceptions, and with nothing from the past to hold us back, we can remember God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#14:7\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">7</span>Beyond this, learning cannot go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"043#14:8\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">8</span>When we are ready, God Himself will take the final step in our return to Him.</span></p></div>
