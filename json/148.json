data-sentence-id=\"148#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you are weary, remember you have hurt yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your Comforter will rest you, but you cannot.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not know how, for if you did you could never have grown weary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Unless you hurt yourself you could never suffer in any way, for that is not God’s Will for His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Pain is not of Him, for He knows no attack and His peace surrounds you silently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God is very quiet, for there is no conflict in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Conflict is the root of all evil, for being blind it does not see whom it attacks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet it always attacks the Son of God, and the Son of God is you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"148#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s Son is indeed in need of comfort, for he knows not what he does, believing his will is not his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Kingdom is his, and yet he wanders homeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>At home in God he is lonely, and amid all his brothers he is friendless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would God let this be real, when He did not will to be alone Himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And if your will is His it cannot be true of you, because it is not true of Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"148#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>O my child, if you knew what God wills for you, your joy would be complete!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what He wills has happened, for it was always true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When the light comes and you have said, “God’s Will is mine,” you will see such beauty that you will know it is not of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Out of your joy you will create beauty in His Name, for your joy could no more be contained than His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The bleak little world will vanish into nothingness, and your heart will be so filled with joy that it will leap into Heaven, and into the Presence of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I cannot tell you what this will be like, for your heart is not ready.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet I can tell you, and remind you often, that what God wills for Himself He wills for you, and what He wills for you is yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"148#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The way is not hard, but it <i>is</i> very different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yours is the way of pain, of which God knows nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That way is hard indeed, and very lonely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fear and grief are your guests, and they go with you and abide with you on the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But the dark journey is not the way of God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Walk in light and do not see the dark companions, for they are not fit companions for the Son of God, who was created <i>of</i> light and <i>in</i> light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Great Light always surrounds you and shines out from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How can you see the dark companions in a light such as this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If you see them, it is only because you are denying the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But deny them instead, for the light is here and the way is clear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"148#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God hides nothing from His Son, even though His Son would hide himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the Son of God cannot hide his glory, for God wills him to be glorious, and gave him the light that shines in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will never lose your way, for God leads you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you wander, you but undertake a journey that is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The dark companions, the dark way, are all illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Turn toward the light, for the little spark in you is part of a light so great that it can sweep you out of all darkness forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For your Father <i>is</i> your Creator, and you <i>are</i> like Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"148#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The children of light cannot abide in darkness, for darkness is not in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not be deceived by the dark comforters, and never let them enter the mind of God’s Son, for they have no place in His temple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you are tempted to deny Him remember that there <i>are</i> no other gods to place before Him, and accept His Will for you in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you cannot accept it otherwise.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"148#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only God’s Comforter can comfort you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the quiet of His temple, He waits to give you the peace that is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Give His peace, that you may enter the temple and find it waiting for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But be holy in the Presence of God, or you will not know that you are there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For what is unlike God cannot enter His Mind, because it was not His Thought and therefore does not belong to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And your mind must be as pure as His, if you would know what belongs to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Guard carefully His temple, for He Himself dwells there and abides in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You cannot enter God’s Presence with the dark companions beside you, but you also cannot enter alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>All your brothers must enter with you, for until you have accepted them <i>you</i> cannot enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For you cannot understand wholeness unless you are whole, and no part of the Son can be excluded if he would know the Wholeness of his Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"148#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In your mind you can accept the whole Sonship and bless it with the light your Father gave it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Then you will be worthy to dwell in the temple with Him, because it is your will not to be alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God blessed His Son forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you will bless him in time, you will be in eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"148#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Time cannot separate you from God if you use it on behalf of the eternal.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"When
