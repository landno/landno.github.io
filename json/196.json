<span data-sentence-id=\"196#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Beyond the poor attraction of the special love relationship, and always obscured by it, is the powerful attraction of the Father for His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no other love that can satisfy you, because there <i>is</i> no other love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the only love that is fully given and fully returned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Being complete, it asks nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Being wholly pure, everyone joined in it has everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is not the basis for any relationship in which the ego enters.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For every relationship on which the ego embarks <i>is</i> special.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego establishes relationships only to get something.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it would keep the giver bound to itself through guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is impossible for the ego to enter into any relationship without anger, for the ego believes that anger makes friends.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is not its statement, but it <i>is</i> its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the ego really believes that it can get and keep <i>by making guilty.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is its one attraction; an attraction so weak that it would have no hold at all, except that no one recognizes it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For the ego always seems to attract through love, and has no attraction at all to anyone who perceives that it attracts through guilt.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The sick attraction of guilt must be recognized for what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For having been made real to you, it is essential to look at it clearly, and by withdrawing your investment in it, to learn to let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one would choose to let go what he believes has value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the attraction of guilt has value to you only because you have not looked at what it is, and have judged it completely in the dark.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As we bring it to light, your only question will be why it was you ever wanted it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have nothing to lose by looking open-eyed, for ugliness such as this belongs not in your holy mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This host of God can have no real investment here.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We said before that the ego attempts to maintain and increase guilt, but in such a way that you do not recognize what it would do to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it is the ego’s fundamental doctrine that what you do to others you have escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego wishes no one well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet its survival depends on your belief that you are exempt from its evil intentions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It counsels, therefore, that if you are host to it, it will enable you to direct its anger outward, thus protecting you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And thus it embarks on an endless, unrewarding chain of special relationships, forged out of anger and dedicated to but one insane belief; that the more anger you invest outside yourself, the safer you become.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is this chain that binds the Son of God to guilt, and it is this chain the Holy Spirit would remove from his holy mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the chain of savagery belongs not around the chosen host of God, who cannot make himself host to the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In the name of his release, and in the Name of Him Who would release him, let us look more closely at the relationships the ego contrives, and let the Holy Spirit judge them truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For it is certain that if you will look at them, you will offer them gladly to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What He can make of them you do not know, but you will become willing to find out, if you are willing first to perceive what you have made of them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In one way or another, every relationship the ego makes is based on the idea that by sacrificing itself, it becomes bigger.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The “sacrifice,” which it regards as purification, is actually the root of its bitter resentment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it would prefer to attack directly, and avoid delaying what it really wants.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the ego acknowledges “reality” as it sees it, and recognizes that no one could interpret direct attack as love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet to make guilty <i>is</i> direct attack, although it does not seem to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the guilty expect attack, and having asked for it they are attracted to it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In such insane relationships, the attraction of what you do not want seems to be much stronger than the attraction of what you do want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For each one thinks that he has sacrificed something to the other, and hates him for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet this is what he thinks he wants.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He is not in love with the other at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He merely believes he is in love with sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And for this sacrifice, which he demands of himself, he demands that the other accept the guilt and sacrifice himself as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Forgiveness becomes impossible, for the ego believes that to forgive another is to lose him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is only by attack without forgiveness that the ego can ensure the guilt that holds all its relationships together.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet they only <i>seem</i> to be together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For relationships, to the ego, mean only that bodies are together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is always this that the ego demands, and it does not object where the mind goes or what it thinks, for this seems unimportant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As long as the body is there to receive its sacrifice, it is content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To the ego the mind is private, and only the body can be shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ideas are basically of no concern, except as they bring the body of another closer or farther.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it is in these terms that it evaluates ideas as good or bad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What makes another guilty and holds him through guilt is “good.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What releases him from guilt is “bad,” because he would no longer believe that bodies communicate, and so he would be “gone.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Suffering and sacrifice are the gifts with which the ego would “bless” all unions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And those who are united at its altar accept suffering and sacrifice as the price of union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In their angry alliances, born of the fear of loneliness and yet dedicated to the continuance of loneliness, each seeks relief from guilt by increasing it in the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For each believes that this decreases guilt in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The other seems always to be attacking and wounding him, perhaps in little ways, perhaps “unconsciously,” yet never without demand of sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The fury of those joined at the ego’s altar far exceeds your awareness of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For what the ego really wants you do not realize.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you are angry, you can be sure that you have formed a special relationship which the ego has “blessed,” for anger <i>is</i> its blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Anger takes many forms, but it cannot long deceive those who will learn that love brings no guilt at all, and what brings guilt cannot be love and <i>must</i> be anger.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All anger is nothing more than an attempt to make someone feel guilty, and this attempt is the only basis the ego accepts for special relationships.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Guilt is the only need the ego has, and as long as you identify with it, guilt will remain attractive to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet remember this; to be with a body is not communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if you think it is, you will feel guilty about communication and will be afraid to hear the Holy Spirit, recognizing in His Voice your own need to communicate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit cannot teach through fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And how can He communicate with you, while you believe that to communicate is to make yourself alone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is clearly insane to believe that by communicating you will be abandoned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet many do believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For they think their minds must be kept private or they will lose them, but if their bodies are together their minds remain their own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The union of bodies thus becomes the way in which they would keep minds apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For bodies cannot forgive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They can only do as the mind directs.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The illusion of the autonomy of the body and its ability to overcome loneliness is but the working of the ego’s plan to establish its own autonomy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As long as you believe that to be with a body is companionship, you will be compelled to attempt to keep your brother in his body, held there by guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you will see safety in guilt and danger in communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the ego will always teach that loneliness is solved by guilt, and that communication is the cause of loneliness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And despite the evident insanity of this lesson, many have learned it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness lies in communication as surely as damnation lies in guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the Holy Spirit’s teaching function to instruct those who believe communication to be damnation that communication is salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And He will do so, for the power of God in Him and you is joined in a real relationship so holy and so strong, that it can overcome even this without fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"196#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is through the holy instant that what seems impossible is accomplished, making it evident that it is not impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the holy instant guilt holds no attraction, since communication has been restored.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And guilt, whose only purpose is to disrupt communication, has no function here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here there is no concealment, and no private thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The willingness to communicate attracts communication to it, and overcomes loneliness completely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is complete forgiveness here, for there is no desire to exclude anyone from your completion, in sudden recognition of the value of his part in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In the protection of your wholeness, all are invited and made welcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you understand that your completion is God’s, Whose only need is to have you be complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For your completion makes you His in your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"196#14:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And here it is that you experience yourself as you were created, and as you are.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Beyond the poor attraction of the special love relationship, and always obscured by it, is the powerful attraction of the Father
