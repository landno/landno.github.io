class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In no situation that arises do you realize the outcome that would make you happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore, you have no guide to appropriate action, and no way of judging the result.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What you do is determined by your perception of the situation, and that perception is wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is inevitable, then, that you will not serve your own best interests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet they are your only goal in any situation which is correctly perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Otherwise, you will not recognize what they are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"426#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you realized that you do not perceive your own best interests, you could be taught what they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But in the presence of your conviction that you do know what they are, you cannot learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The idea for today is a step toward opening your mind so that learning can begin.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"426#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The exercises for today require much more honesty than you are accustomed to using.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A few subjects, honestly and carefully considered in each of the five practice periods which should be undertaken today, will be more helpful than a more cursory examination of a large number.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Two minutes are suggested for each of the mind-searching periods which the exercises involve.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"426#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The practice periods should begin with repeating today‚Äôs idea, followed by searching the mind, with closed eyes, for unresolved situations about which you are currently concerned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The emphasis should be on uncovering the outcome you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will quickly realize that you have a number of goals in mind as part of the desired outcome, and also that these goals are on different levels and often conflict.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"426#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In applying the idea for today, name each situation that occurs to you, and then enumerate carefully as many goals as possible that you would like to be met in its resolution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The form of each application should be roughly as follows:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"426#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In the situation involving _________, I would like _________ to happen, and _________ to happen,</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"426#5:3\">and so on.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Try to cover as many different kinds of outcomes as may honestly occur to you, even if some of them do not appear to be directly related to the situation, or even to be inherent in it at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"426#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If these exercises are done properly, you will quickly recognize that you are making a large number of demands of the situation which have nothing to do with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will also recognize that many of your goals are contradictory, that you have no unified outcome in mind, and that you must experience disappointment in connection with some of your goals, however the situation turns out.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"426#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"426#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>After covering the list of as many hoped-for goals as possible, for each unresolved situation that crosses your mind say to yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"426#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I do not perceive my own best interests in this situation,</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"426#7:2\">and go on to the next one.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"In no situation that arises do you realize the outcome that would make you
