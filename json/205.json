data-sentence-id=\"205#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be not afraid to look upon the special hate relationship, for freedom lies in looking at it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It would be impossible not to know the meaning of love, except for this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the special love relationship, in which the meaning of love is hidden, is undertaken solely to offset the hate, but not to let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your salvation will rise clearly before your open eyes as you look on this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You cannot limit hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The special love relationship will not offset it, but will merely drive it underground and out of sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is essential to bring it into sight, and to make no attempt to hide it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For it is the attempt to balance hate with love that makes love meaningless to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The extent of the split that lies in this you do not realize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And until you do the split will remain unrecognized, and therefore unhealed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The symbols of hate against the symbols of love play out a conflict that does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For symbols stand for something else, and the symbol of love is without meaning if love is everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will go through this last undoing quite unharmed, and will at last emerge as yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the last step in the readiness for God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be not unwilling now; you are too near, and you will cross the bridge in perfect safety, translated quietly from war to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the illusion of love will never satisfy, but its reality, which awaits you on the other side, will give you everything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The special love relationship is an attempt to limit the destructive effects of hate by finding a haven in the storm of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It makes no attempt to rise above the storm, into the sunlight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>On the contrary, it emphasizes the guilt outside the haven by attempting to build barricades against it, and keep within them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The special love relationship is not perceived as a value in itself, but as a place of safety from which hatred is split off and kept apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The special love partner is acceptable only as long as he serves this purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Hatred can enter, and indeed is welcome in some aspects of the relationship, but it is still held together by the illusion of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If the illusion goes, the relationship is broken or becomes unsatisfying on the grounds of disillusionment.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Love is not an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Where disillusionment is possible, there was not love but hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For hate <i>is</i> an illusion, and what can change was never love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is sure that those who select certain ones as partners in any aspect of living, and use them for any purpose which they would not share with others, are trying to live with guilt rather than die of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the choice they see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And love, to them, is only an escape from death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They seek it desperately, but not in the peace in which it would gladly come quietly to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And when they find the fear of death is still upon them, the love relationship loses the illusion that it is what it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>When the barricades against it are broken, fear rushes in and hatred triumphs.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There are no triumphs of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only hate is at all concerned with the “triumph of love.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The illusion of love can triumph over the illusion of hate, but always at the price of making both illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As long as the illusion of hatred lasts, so long will love be an illusion to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And then the only choice remaining possible is which illusion you prefer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There <i>is</i> no conflict in the choice between truth and illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Seen in these terms, no one would hesitate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But conflict enters the instant the choice seems to be one between illusions, but this choice does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Where one choice is as dangerous as the other, the decision must be one of despair.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it <i>is</i> necessary to seek for what is false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every illusion is one of fear, whatever form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And the attempt to escape from one illusion into another must fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you seek love outside yourself you can be certain that you perceive hatred within, and are afraid of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet peace will never come from the illusion of love, but only from its reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Recognize this, for it is true, and truth must be recognized if it is to be distinguished from illusion: The special love relationship is an attempt to bring love into separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And, as such, it is nothing more than an attempt to bring love into fear, and make it real in fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In fundamental violation of love’s one condition, the special love relationship would accomplish the impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How but in illusion could this be done?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is essential that we look very closely at exactly what it is you think you can do to solve the dilemma which seems very real to you, but which does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have come close to truth, and only this stands between you and the bridge that leads you into it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Heaven waits silently, and your creations are holding out their hands to help you cross and welcome them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it is they you seek.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You seek but for your own completion, and it is they who render you complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The special love relationship is but a shabby substitute for what makes you whole in truth, not in illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your relationship with them is without guilt, and this enables you to look on all your brothers with gratitude, because your creations were created in union with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Acceptance of your creations is the acceptance of the Oneness of creation, without which you could never be complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No specialness can offer you what God has given, and what you are joined with Him in giving.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Across the bridge is your completion, for you will be wholly in God, willing for nothing special, but only to be wholly like to Him, completing Him by your completion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Fear not to cross to the abode of peace and perfect holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only there is the completion of God and of His Son established forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Seek not for this in the bleak world of illusion, where nothing is certain and where everything fails to satisfy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In the Name of God, be wholly willing to abandon all illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In any relationship in which you are wholly willing to accept completion, and only this, there is God completed, and His Son with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The bridge that leads to union in yourself <i>must</i> lead to knowledge, for it was built with God beside you, and will lead you straight to Him where your completion rests, wholly compatible with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every illusion you accept into your mind by judging it to be attainable removes your own sense of completion, and thus denies the Wholeness of your Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every fantasy, be it of love or hate, deprives you of knowledge for fantasies are the veil behind which truth is hidden.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To lift the veil that seems so dark and heavy, it is only needful to value truth beyond all fantasy, and to be entirely unwilling to settle for illusion in place of truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:1\"><span class=\"snr

data-sentence-id=\"205#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Love calls, but hate would have you stay.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Hear not the call of hate, and see no fantasies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For your completion lies in truth, and nowhere else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>See in the call of hate, and in every fantasy that rises to delay you, but the call for help that rises ceaselessly from you to your Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Would He not answer you whose completion is His?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He loves you, wholly without illusion, as you must love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For love <i>is</i> wholly without illusion, and therefore wholly without fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Whom God remembers must be whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And God has never forgotten what makes Him whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>In your completion lie the memory of His Wholeness and His gratitude to you for His completion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>In His link with you lie both His inability to forget and your ability to remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#11:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>In Him are joined your willingness to love and all the Love of God, Who forgot you not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"205#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit is the Bridge to Him, made from your willingness to unite with Him and created by His joy in union with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The journey that seemed endless is almost complete, for what <i>is</i> endless is very near.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have almost recognized it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Turn with me firmly away from all illusions now, and let nothing stand in the way of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We will take the last useless journey away from truth together, and then together we go straight to God, in joyous answer to His Call for His completion.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"205#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If special relationships of any kind would hinder God’s completion, can they have any value to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What would interfere with God must interfere with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only in time does interference in God’s completion seem to be possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The bridge that He would carry you across lifts you from time into eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Waken from time, and answer fearlessly the Call of Him Who gave eternity to you in your creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>On this side of the bridge to timelessness you understand nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But as you step lightly across it, upheld <i>by</i> timelessness, you are directed straight to the Heart of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>At its center, and only there, you are safe forever, because you are complete forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There is no veil the Love of God in us together cannot lift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The way to truth is open.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"205#13:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Follow it with
