data-sentence-id=\"122#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If God’s Will for you is complete peace and joy, unless you experience only this you must be refusing to acknowledge His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His Will does not vacillate, being changeless forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you are not at peace it can only be because you do not believe you are in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet He is All in all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His peace is complete, and you must be included in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His laws govern you because they govern everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You cannot exempt yourself from His laws, although you can disobey them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet if you do, and only if you do, you will feel lonely and helpless, because you are denying yourself everything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"122#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I am come as a light into a world that does deny itself everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does this simply by dissociating itself from everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is therefore an illusion of isolation, maintained by fear of the same loneliness that <i>is</i> its illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I said that I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is why I am the light of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If I am with you in the loneliness of the world, the loneliness is gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You cannot maintain the illusion of loneliness if you are not alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>My purpose, then, is still to overcome the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I do not attack it, but my light must dispel it because of what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Light does not attack darkness, but it does shine it away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>If my light goes with you everywhere, you shine it away with me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The light becomes ours, and you cannot abide in darkness any more than darkness can abide wherever you go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#2:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>The remembrance of me is the remembrance of yourself, and of Him Who sent me to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"122#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You were in darkness until God’s Will was done completely by any part of the Sonship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When this was done, it was perfectly accomplished by all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How else could it be perfectly accomplished?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>My mission was simply to unite the will of the Sonship with the Will of the Father by being aware of the Father’s Will myself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the awareness I came to give you, and your problem in accepting it is the problem of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Dispelling it is salvation, and in this sense I <i>am</i> the salvation of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The world must therefore despise and reject me, because the world <i>is</i> the belief that love is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you will accept the fact that I am with you, you are denying the world and accepting God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>My will is His, and your decision to hear me is the decision to hear His Voice and abide in His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>As God sent me to you so will I send you to others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And I will go to them with you, so we can teach them peace and union.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"122#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do you not think the world needs peace as much as you do?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do you not want to give it to the world as much as you want to receive it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For unless you do, you will not receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you want to have it of me, you must give it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Healing does not come from anyone else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You must accept guidance from within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The guidance must be what you want, or it will be meaningless to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>That is why healing is a collaborative venture.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I can tell you what to do, but you must collaborate by believing that I know what you should do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Only then will your mind choose to follow me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Without this choice you could not be healed because you would have decided against healing, and this rejection of my decision for you makes healing impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"122#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing reflects our joint will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is obvious when you consider what healing is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Healing is the way in which the separation is overcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Separation is overcome by union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It cannot be overcome by separating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The decision to unite must be unequivocal, or the mind itself is divided and not whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your mind is the means by which you determine your own condition, because mind is the mechanism of decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is the power by which you separate or join, and experience pain or joy accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>My decision cannot overcome yours, because yours is as powerful as mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If it were not so the Sons of God would be unequal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>All things are possible through our joint decision, but mine alone cannot help you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Your will is as free as mine, and God Himself would not go against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>I cannot will what God does not will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#5:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>I can offer my strength to make yours invincible, but I cannot oppose your decision without competing with it and thereby violating God’s Will for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"122#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing God created can oppose your decision, as nothing God created can oppose His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God gave your will its power, which I can only acknowledge in honor of His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you want to be like me I will help you, knowing that we are alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you want to be different, I will wait until you change your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I can teach you, but only you can choose to listen to my teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How else can it be, if God’s Kingdom is freedom?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Freedom cannot be learned by tyranny of any kind, and the perfect equality of all God’s Sons cannot be recognized through the dominion of one mind over another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God’s Sons are equal in will, all being the Will of their Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is the only lesson I came to teach.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"122#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If your will were not mine it would not be our Father’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This would mean you have imprisoned yours, and have not let it be free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Of yourself you can do nothing, because of yourself you <i>are</i> nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am nothing without the Father and you are nothing without me, because by denying the Father you deny yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I will always remember you, and in my remembrance of you lies your remembrance of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In our remembrance of each other lies our remembrance of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in this remembrance lies your freedom because your freedom is in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Join, then, with me in praise of Him and you whom He created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is our gift of gratitude to Him, which He will share with all His creations, to whom He gives equally whatever is acceptable to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Because it is acceptable to Him it is the gift of freedom, which is His Will for all His Sons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>By offering freedom you will be free.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"122#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Freedom is the only gift you can offer to God’s Sons, being an acknowledgment of what they are and what He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Freedom is creation, because it is love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whom you seek to imprison you do not love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore, when you seek to imprison anyone, including yourself, you do not love him and you cannot identify with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When you imprison yourself you are losing sight of your true identification with me and with the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your identification is with the Father <i>and</i> with the Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It cannot be with One and not the Other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you are part of One you must be part of the Other, because They are One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The Holy Trinity is holy <i>because</i> It is One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If you exclude yourself from this union, you are perceiving the Holy Trinity as separated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You must be included in It, because It is everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Unless you take your place in It and fulfill your function as part of It, the Holy Trinity is as bereft as you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"122#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>No part of It can be imprisoned if Its truth is to be known.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"If God’s Will for you
