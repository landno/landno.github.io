data-sentence-id=\"334#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Decisions are continuous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not always know when you are making them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But with a little practice with the ones you recognize, a set begins to form which sees you through the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not wise to let yourself become preoccupied with every step you take.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The proper set, adopted consciously each time you wake, will put you well ahead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if you find resistance strong and dedication weak, you are not ready.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span><i>Do not fight yourself.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But think about the kind of day you want, and tell yourself there is a way in which this very day can happen just like that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Then try again to have the day you want.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(1) The outlook starts with this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today I will make no decisions by myself.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This means that you are choosing not to be the judge of what to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But it must also mean you will not judge the situations where you will be called upon to make response.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For if you judge them, you have set the rules for how you should react to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And then another answer cannot but produce confusion and uncertainty and fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is your major problem now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You still make up your mind, and <i>then</i> decide to ask what you should do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what you hear may not resolve the problem as you saw it first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This leads to fear, because it contradicts what you perceive and so you feel attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And therefore angry.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There are rules by which this will not happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But it does occur at first, while you are learning how to hear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(2) Throughout the day, at any time you think of it and have a quiet moment for reflection, tell yourself again the kind of day you want; the feelings you would have, the things you want to happen to you, and the things you would experience, and say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If I make no decisions by myself, this is the day that will be given me.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These two procedures, practiced well, will serve to let you be directed without fear, for opposition will not first arise and then become a problem in itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But there will still be times when you have judged already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now the answer will provoke attack, unless you quickly straighten out your mind to want an answer that will work.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Be certain this has happened if you feel yourself unwilling to sit by and ask to have the answer given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This means you have decided by yourself, and can not see the question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now you need a quick restorative before you ask again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(3) Remember once again the day you want, and recognize that something has occurred that is not part of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Then realize that you have asked a question by yourself, and must have set an answer in your terms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I have no question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I forgot what to decide.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This cancels out the terms that you have set, and lets the answer show you what the question must have really been.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Try to observe this rule without delay, despite your opposition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you have already gotten angry.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And your fear of being answered in a different way from what your version of the question asks will gain momentum, until you believe the day you want is one in which you get <i>your</i> answer to <i>your</i> question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will not get it, for it would destroy the day by robbing you of what you really want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This can be very hard to realize, when once you have decided by yourself the rules that promise you a happy day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet this decision still can be undone, by simple methods that you can accept.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(4) If you are so unwilling to receive you cannot even let your question go, you can begin to change your mind with this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>At least I can decide I do not like what I feel now.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This much is obvious, and paves the way for the next easy step.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(5) Having decided that you do not like the way you feel, what could be easier than to continue with:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so I hope I have been wrong.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This works against the sense of opposition, and reminds you that help is not being thrust upon you but is something that you want and that you need, because you do not like the way you feel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This tiny opening will be enough to let you go ahead with just a few more steps you need to let yourself be helped.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now you have reached the turning point, because it has occurred to you that you will gain if what you have decided is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Until this point is reached, you will believe your happiness depends on being right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But this much reason have you now attained; you would be better off if you were wrong.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(6) This tiny grain of wisdom will suffice to take you further.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are not coerced, but merely hope to get a thing you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you can say in perfect honesty:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I want another way to look at this.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now you have changed your mind about the day, and have remembered what you really want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Its purpose has no longer been obscured by the insane belief you want it for the goal of being right when you are wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Thus is the readiness for asking brought to your awareness, for you cannot be in conflict when you ask for what you want, and see that it is this for which you ask.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(7) This final step is but acknowledgment of lack of opposition to be helped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a statement of an open mind, not certain yet, but willing to be shown:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Perhaps there is another way to look at this.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What can I lose by asking?</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"334#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus you now can ask a question that makes sense, and so the answer will make sense as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nor will you fight against it, for you see that it is you who will be helped by it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It must be clear that it is easier to have a happy day if you prevent unhappiness from entering at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But this takes practice in the rules that will protect you from the ravages of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When this has been achieved, the sorry dream of judgment has forever been undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But meanwhile, you have need for practicing the rules for its undoing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let us, then, consider once again the very first of the decisions which are offered here.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We said you can begin a happy day with the determination not to make decisions by yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This seems to be a real decision in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And yet, you <i>cannot</i> make decisions by yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The only question really is with what you choose to make them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is really all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The first rule, then, is not coercion, but a simple statement of a simple fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You will not make decisions by yourself whatever you decide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For they are made with idols or with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#14:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And you ask help of anti-Christ or Christ, and which you choose will join with you and tell you what to do.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your day is not at random.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is set by what you choose to live it with, and how the friend whose counsel you have sought perceives your happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You always ask advice before you can decide on anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let this be understood, and you can see there cannot be coercion here, nor grounds for opposition that you may be free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no freedom from what must occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if you think there is, you must be wrong.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The second rule as well is but a fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you and your adviser must agree on what you want before it can occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is but this agreement that permits all things to happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing can be caused without some form of union, be it with a dream of judgment or the Voice for God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Decisions cause results <i>because</i> they are not made in isolation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They are made by you and your adviser, for yourself and for the world as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#16:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The day you want you offer to the world, for it will be what you have asked for, and will reinforce the rule of your adviser in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#16:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Whose kingdom is the world for you today?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#16:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What kind of day will you decide to have?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"334#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It needs but two who would have happiness this day to promise it to all the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It needs but two to understand that they cannot decide alone, to guarantee the joy they asked for will be wholly shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For they have understood the basic law that makes decision powerful, and gives it all effects that it will ever have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It needs but two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>These two are joined before there can be a decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#17:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let this be the one reminder that you keep in mind, and you will have the day you want, and give it to the world by having it yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#17:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your judgment has been lifted from the world by your decision for a happy day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"334#17:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And as you have received, so must you give.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Decisions are continuous.
