importance of the reversal of your thinking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"422#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The salvation of the world depends on it.</span> <span

class=\"snr\">3</span>You want salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"422#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You want to be happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"422#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You want peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"422#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not have them now, because your mind is totally undisciplined, and you cannot distinguish between joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain, love and fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"422#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are now learning how to tell them apart.</span> <span

least twice an hour today, attempting to do so every half hour.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"422#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not be distressed if you forget to do so, but make a real effort to remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"422#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The extra repetitions should be applied to any situation, person or event that upsets you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"422#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can see them differently, and you will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"422#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you desire you will
