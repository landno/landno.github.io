as soon as possible after waking take your quiet time, continuing a minute or two after you begin to find it difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You may find that the difficulty will diminish and drop away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If not, that is the time to stop.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"831#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The same procedures should be followed at night.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps your quiet time should be fairly early in the evening, if it is not feasible for you to take it just before going to sleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not wise to lie down for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is better to sit up, in whatever position you prefer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Having gone through the workbook, you must have come to some conclusions in this respect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If possible, however, just before going to sleep is a desirable time to devote to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It sets your mind into a pattern of rest, and orients you away from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If it is expedient to spend this time earlier, at least be sure that you do not forget a brief period,—not more than a moment will do,—in which you close your eyes and think of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"831#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is one thought in particular that should be remembered throughout the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"831#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a thought of pure joy;
