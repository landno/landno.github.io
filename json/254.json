data-sentence-id=\"254#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All special relationships have sin as their goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For they are bargains with reality, toward which the seeming union is adjusted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forget not this; to bargain is to set a limit, and any brother with whom you have a limited relationship, you hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You may attempt to keep the bargain in the name of “fairness,” sometimes demanding payment of yourself, perhaps more often of the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus in the “fairness” you attempt to ease the guilt that comes from the accepted purpose of the relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And that is why the Holy Spirit must change its purpose to make it useful to Him and harmless to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you accept this change, you have accepted the idea of making room for truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The <i>source</i> of sin is gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You may imagine that you still experience its effects, but it is not your purpose and you no longer want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one allows a purpose to be replaced while he desires it, for nothing is so cherished and protected as is a goal the mind accepts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This it will follow, grimly or happily, but always with faith and with the persistence that faith inevitably brings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The power of faith is never recognized if it is placed in sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But it is always recognized if it is placed in love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why is it strange to you that faith can move mountains?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is indeed a little feat for such a power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For faith can keep the Son of God in chains as long as he believes he is in chains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And when he is released from them it will be simply because he no longer believes in them, withdrawing faith that they can hold him, and placing it in his freedom instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is impossible to place equal faith in opposite directions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What faith you give to sin you take away from holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And what you offer holiness has been removed from sin.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Faith and belief and vision are the means by which the goal of holiness is reached.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Through them the Holy Spirit leads you to the real world, and away from all illusions where your faith was laid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is His direction; the only one He ever sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And when you wander, He reminds you there is but one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His faith and His belief and vision are all for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And when you have accepted them completely instead of yours, you will have need of them no longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For faith and vision and belief are meaningful only before the state of certainty is reached.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In Heaven they are unknown.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet Heaven is reached through them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible that the Son of God lack faith, but he can choose where he would have it be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Faithlessness is not a lack of faith, but faith in nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Faith given to illusions does not lack power, for by it does the Son of God believe that he is powerless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus is he faithless to himself, but strong in faith in his illusions about himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For faith, perception and belief you made, as means for losing certainty and finding sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This mad direction was your choice, and by your faith in what you chose, you made what you desired.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit has a use for all the means for sin by which you sought to find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But as He uses them they lead away from sin, because His purpose lies in the opposite direction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He sees the means you use, but not the purpose for which you made them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He would not take them from you, for He sees their value as a means for what He wills for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You made perception that you might choose among your brothers, and seek for sin with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit sees perception as a means to teach you that the vision of a holy relationship is all you <i>want</i> to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Then will you give your faith to holiness, desiring and believing in it because of your desire.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Faith and belief become attached to vision, as all the means that once served sin are redirected now toward holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For what you think is sin is limitation, and whom you try to limit to the body you hate because you fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In your refusal to forgive him, you would condemn him to the body because the means for sin are dear to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so the body has your faith and your belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But holiness would set your brother free, removing hatred by removing fear, not as a symptom, but at its source.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those who would free their brothers from the body can have no fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They have renounced the means for sin by choosing to let all limitations be removed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As they desire to look upon their brothers in holiness, the power of their belief and faith sees far beyond the body, supporting vision, not obstructing it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But first they chose to recognize how much their faith had limited their understanding of the world, desiring to place its power elsewhere should another point of view be given them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The miracles that follow this decision are also born of faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For all who choose to look away from sin are given vision, and are led to holiness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those who believe in sin must think the Holy Spirit asks for sacrifice, for this is how they think <i>their</i> purpose is accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Brother, the Holy Spirit knows that sacrifice brings nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He makes no bargains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if you seek to limit Him, you will hate Him because you are afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The gift that He has given you is more than anything that stands this side of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The instant for its recognition is at hand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Join your awareness to what has been already joined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The faith you give your brother can accomplish this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For He Who loves the world is seeing it for you, without one spot of sin upon it, and in the innocence that makes the sight of it as beautiful as Heaven.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your faith in sacrifice has given it great power in your sight; except you do not realize you cannot see because of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For sacrifice must be exacted of a body, and by another body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The mind could neither ask it nor receive it of itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And no more could the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The intention is in the mind, which tries to use the body to carry out the means for sin in which the mind believes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thus is the joining of mind and body an inescapable belief of those who value sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so is sacrifice invariably a means for limitation, and thus for hate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think you the Holy Spirit is concerned with this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He gives not what it is His purpose to lead you <i>from</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You think He would deprive you for your good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But “good” and “deprivation” are opposites, and cannot meaningfully join in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is like saying that the moon and sun are one because they come with night and day, and so they must be joined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet sight of one is but the sign the other has disappeared from sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor is it possible that what gives light be one with what depends on darkness to be seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Neither demands the sacrifice of the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet on the absence of the other does each depend.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"254#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body was made to be a sacrifice to sin, and in the darkness so it still is seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet in the light of vision it is looked upon quite differently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can have faith in it to serve the Holy Spirit’s goal, and give it power to serve as means to help the blind to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But in their seeing they look past it, as do you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The faith and the belief you gave it belongs beyond.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You gave perception and belief and faith from mind to body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"254#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let them now be given back to what produced them, and can use them still to save itself from what it made.</span></p></div>
