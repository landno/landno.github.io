class=\"acim-text chap-18-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"223#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Prepare you <i>now</i> for the undoing of what never was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you already understood the difference between truth and illusion, the Atonement would have no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The holy instant, the holy relationship, the Holy Spirit’s teaching, and all the means by which salvation is accomplished, would have no purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For they are all but aspects of the plan to change your dreams of fear to happy dreams, from which you waken easily to knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Put yourself not in charge of this, for you cannot distinguish between advance and retreat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"223#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Never approach the holy instant after you have tried to remove all fear and hatred from your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is <i>its</i> function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Never attempt to overlook your guilt before you ask the Holy Spirit’s help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is <i>His</i> function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your part is only to offer Him a little willingness to let Him remove all fear and hatred, and to be forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>On your little faith, joined with His understanding, He will build your part in the Atonement and make sure that you fulfill it easily.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And with Him, you will build a ladder planted in the solid rock of faith, and rising even to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nor will you use it to ascend to Heaven alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"223#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Through your holy relationship, reborn and blessed in every holy instant you do not arrange, thousands will rise to Heaven with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can you plan for this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Or could you prepare yourself for such a function?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it is possible, because God wills it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor will He change His Mind about it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The means and purpose both belong to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have accepted one; the other will be provided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>A purpose such as this, without the means, is inconceivable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He will provide the means to anyone who shares His purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"223#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Happy dreams come true, not because they are dreams, but only because they are happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so they must be loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Their message is, “Thy Will be done,” and not, “I want it otherwise.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The alignment of means and purpose is an undertaking impossible for you to understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not even realize you have accepted the Holy Spirit’s purpose as your own, and you would merely bring unholy means to its accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The little faith it needed to change the purpose is all that is required to receive the means and use them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"223#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is no dream to love your brother as yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor is your holy relationship a dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All that remains of dreams within it is that it is still a special relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it is very useful to the Holy Spirit, Who <i>has</i> a special function here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It will become the happy dream through which He can spread joy to thousands on thousands who believe that love is fear, not happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let Him fulfill the function that He gave to your relationship by accepting it for you, and nothing will be wanting that would make of it what He would have it be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"223#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you feel the holiness of your relationship is threatened by anything, stop instantly and offer the Holy Spirit your willingness, in spite of fear, to let Him exchange this instant for the holy one that you would rather have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He will never fail in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But forget not that your relationship is one, and so it must be that whatever threatens the peace of one is an equal threat to the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The power of joining its blessing lies in the fact that it is now impossible for you or your brother to experience fear alone, or to attempt to deal with it alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Never believe that this is necessary, or even possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet just as this is impossible, so is it equally impossible that the holy instant come to either of you without the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it will come to both at the request of either.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"223#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whoever is saner at the time the threat is perceived should remember how deep is his indebtedness to the other and how much gratitude is due him, and be glad that he can pay his debt by bringing happiness to both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let him remember this, and say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"223#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I desire this holy instant for myself, that I may share it with my brother, whom I love.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not possible that I can have it without him, or he without me.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it is wholly possible for us to share it now.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"223#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And so I choose this instant as the one to offer to the Holy Spirit, that His blessing may descend on us, and keep us both in peace.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Prepare you now for the undoing of what never was.
