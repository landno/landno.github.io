noprint\">1</span>If sin is real, then punishment is just and cannot be escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Salvation thus cannot be purchased but through suffering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If sin is real, then happiness must be illusion, for they cannot both be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The sinful warrant only death and pain, and it is this they ask for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For they know it waits for them, and it will seek them out and find them somewhere, sometime, in some form that evens the account they owe to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They would escape Him in their fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And yet He will pursue, and they can not escape.</span></p></div> <div

<span data-sentence-id=\"505#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Pain is the cost of sin, and suffering can never be escaped, if sin is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Salvation must be feared, for it will kill, but slowly, taking everything away before it grants the welcome boon of death to victims who are little more than bones before salvation is appeased.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its wrath is boundless, merciless, but wholly just.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"505#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who would seek out such savage punishment?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who would not flee salvation, and attempt in every way he can to drown the Voice which offers it to him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Why would he try to listen and accept Its offering?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If sin is real, its offering is death, and meted out in cruel form to match the vicious wishes in which sin is born.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If sin is real, salvation has become your bitter enemy, the curse of God upon you who have crucified His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"505#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You need the practice periods today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The exercises teach sin is not real, and all that you believe must come from sin will never happen, for it has no cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Accept Atonement with an open mind, which cherishes no lingering belief that you have made a devil of God‚Äôs Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We practice with this thought as often as we can today, because it is the basis for today‚Äôs idea.</span></p></div> <div

there is no sin, and suffering is causeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Joy is just, and pain is but the sign you have misunderstood yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fear not the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But turn to it in confidence that it will set you free from all the consequences sin has wrought in feverish imagination.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span

consequence.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"505#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>So should you start your practice periods, and then attempt again to find the joy these thoughts will introduce into your mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"505#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#7:1\"><span class=\"snr

class=\"snr\">2</span>Today escape from madness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are set on freedom‚Äôs road, and now today‚Äôs idea brings wings to speed you on, and hope to go still faster to the waiting goal of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#7:5\"><span

perfect happiness.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"505#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the truth, because there is no sin.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today we will continue
