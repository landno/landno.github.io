class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The wish to be unfairly treated is a compromise attempt that would combine attack and innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who can combine the wholly incompatible, and make a unity of what can never join?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Walk you the gentle way, and you will fear no evil and no shadows in the night.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But place no terror symbols on your path, or you will weave a crown of thorns from which your brother and yourself will not escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You cannot crucify yourself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if you are unfairly treated, he must suffer the unfairness that you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You cannot sacrifice yourself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For sacrifice is total.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If it could occur at all it would entail the whole of God’s creation, and the Father with the sacrifice of His beloved Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In your release from sacrifice is his made manifest, and shown to be his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But every pain you suffer do you see as proof that he is guilty of attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus would you make yourself to be the sign that he has lost his innocence, and need but look on you to realize that he has been condemned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what to you has been unfair will come to him in righteousness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The unjust vengeance that you suffer now belongs to him, and when it rests on him are you set free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Wish not to make yourself a living symbol of his guilt, for you will not escape the death you made for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But in his innocence you find your own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you consent to suffer pain, to be deprived, unfairly treated or in need of anything, you but accuse your brother of attack upon God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You hold a picture of your crucifixion before his eyes, that he may see his sins are writ in Heaven in your blood and death, and go before him, closing off the gate and damning him to hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet this is writ in hell and not in Heaven, where you are beyond attack and prove his innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The picture of yourself you offer him you show yourself, and give it all your faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit offers you, to give to him, a picture of yourself in which there is no pain and no reproach at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what was martyred to his guilt becomes the perfect witness to his innocence.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The power of witness is beyond belief because it brings conviction in its wake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The witness is believed because he points beyond himself to what he represents.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A sick and suffering you but represents your brother’s guilt; the witness that you send lest he forget the injuries he gave, from which you swear he never will escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This sick and sorry picture <i>you</i> accept, if only it can serve to punish him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The sick are merciless to everyone, and in contagion do they seek to kill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Death seems an easy price, if they can say, “Behold me, brother, at your hand I die.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For sickness is the witness to his guilt, and death would prove his errors must be sins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Sickness is but a “little” death; a form of vengeance not yet total.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet it speaks with certainty for what it represents.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The bleak and bitter picture you have sent your brother <i>you</i> have looked upon in grief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And everything that it has shown to him have you believed, because it witnessed to the guilt in him which you perceived and loved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now in the hands made gentle by His touch, the Holy Spirit lays a picture of a different you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a picture of a body still, for what you really are cannot be seen nor pictured.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet this one has not been used for purpose of attack, and therefore never suffered pain at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It witnesses to the eternal truth that you cannot be hurt, and points beyond itself to both your innocence and his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Show this unto your brother, who will see that every scar is healed, and every tear is wiped away in laughter and in love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And he will look on his forgiveness there, and with healed eyes will look beyond it to the innocence that he beholds in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here is the proof that he has never sinned; that nothing which his madness bid him do was ever done, or ever had effects of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>That no reproach he laid upon his heart was ever justified, and no attack can ever touch him with the poisoned and relentless sting of fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Attest his innocence and not his guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your healing is his comfort and his health because it proves illusions are not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not will for life but wish for death that is the motivation for this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its only purpose is to prove guilt real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No worldly thought or act or feeling has a motivation other than this one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>These are the witnesses that are called forth to be believed, and lend conviction to the system they speak for and represent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And each has many voices, speaking to your brother and yourself in different tongues.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And yet to both the message is the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Adornment of the body seeks to show how lovely are the witnesses for guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Concerns about the body demonstrate how frail and vulnerable is your life; how easily destroyed is what you love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Depression speaks of death, and vanity of real concern with anything at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The strongest witness to futility, that bolsters all the rest and helps them paint the picture in which sin is justified, is sickness in whatever form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The sick have reason for each one of their unnatural desires and strange needs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For who could live a life so soon cut short and not esteem the worth of passing joys?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What pleasures could there be that will endure?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Are not the frail entitled to believe that every stolen scrap of pleasure is their righteous payment for their little lives?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Their death will pay the price for all of them, if they enjoy their benefits or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The end of life must come, whatever way that life be spent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so take pleasure in the quickly passing and ephemeral.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These are not sins, but witnesses unto the strange belief that sin and death are real, and innocence and sin will end alike within the termination of the grave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If this were true, there would be reason to remain content to seek for passing joys and cherish little pleasures where you can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet in this picture is the body not perceived as neutral and without a goal inherent in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For it becomes the symbol of reproach, the sign of guilt whose consequences still are there to see, so that the cause can never be denied.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your function is to show your brother sin can have no cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How futile must it be to see yourself a picture of the proof that what your function is can never be!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit’s picture changes not the body into something it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It only takes away from it all signs of accusation and of blamefulness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Pictured without a purpose, it is seen as neither sick nor well, nor bad nor good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No grounds are offered that it may be judged in any way at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It has no life, but neither is it dead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It stands apart from all experience of love or fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For now it witnesses to nothing yet, its purpose being open, and the mind made free again to choose what it is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Now is it not condemned, but waiting for a purpose to be given, that it may fulfill the function that it will receive.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Into this empty space, from which the goal of sin has been removed, is Heaven free to be remembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here its peace can come, and perfect healing take the place of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body can become a sign of life, a promise of redemption, and a breath of immortality to those grown sick of breathing in the fetid scent of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let it have healing as its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Then will it send forth the message it received, and by its health and loveliness proclaim the truth and value that it represents.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let it receive the power to represent an endless life, forever unattacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And to your brother let its message be, “Behold me, brother, at your hand I live.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"306#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The simple way to let this be achieved is merely this; to let the body have no purpose from the past, when you were sure you knew its purpose was to foster guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this insists your crippled picture is a lasting sign of what it represents.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This leaves no space in which a different view, another purpose, can be given it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do <i>not</i> know its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You but gave illusions of a purpose to a thing you made to hide your function from yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This thing without a purpose cannot hide the function that the Holy Spirit gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"306#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let, then, its purpose and your function both be reconciled at last and seen as one.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The wish to be unfairly treated is a compromise
