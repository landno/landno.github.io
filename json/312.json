data-sentence-id=\"312#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Suffering is an emphasis upon all that the world has done to injure you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is the world’s demented version of salvation clearly shown.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Like to a dream of punishment, in which the dreamer is unconscious of what brought on the attack against himself, he sees himself attacked unjustly and by something not himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He is the victim of this “something else,” a thing outside himself, for which he has no reason to be held responsible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He must be innocent because he knows not what he does, but what is done to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet is his own attack upon himself apparent still, for it is he who bears the suffering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And he cannot escape because its source is seen outside himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now you are being shown you <i>can</i> escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All that is needed is you look upon the problem as it is, and not the way that you have set it up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How could there be another way to solve a problem that is very simple, but has been obscured by heavy clouds of complication, which were made to keep the problem unresolved?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Without the clouds the problem will emerge in all its primitive simplicity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The choice will not be difficult, because the problem is absurd when clearly seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No one has difficulty making up his mind to let a simple problem be resolved if it is seen as hurting him, and also very easily removed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The “reasoning” by which the world is made, on which it rests, by which it is maintained, is simply this: “<i>You</i> are the cause of what I do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your presence justifies my wrath, and you exist and think apart from me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>While you attack I must be innocent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what I suffer from is your attack.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one who looks upon this “reasoning” exactly as it is could fail to see it does not follow and it makes no sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it seems sensible, because it looks as if the world were hurting you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so it seems as if there is no need to go beyond the obvious in terms of cause.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is indeed a need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world’s escape from condemnation is a need which those within the world are joined in sharing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet they do not recognize their common need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For each one thinks that if he does his part, the condemnation of the world will rest on him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is this that he perceives to <i>be</i> his part in its deliverance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Vengeance must have a focus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Otherwise is the avenger’s knife in his own hand, and pointed to himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And he must see it in another’s hand, if he would be a victim of attack he did not choose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And thus he suffers from the wounds a knife he does not hold has made upon himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the purpose of the world he sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And looked at thus, the world provides the means by which this purpose seems to be fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The means attest the purpose, but are not themselves a cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor will the cause be changed by seeing it apart from its effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The cause produces the effects, which then bear witness to the cause, and not themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Look, then, beyond effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is not here the cause of suffering and sin must lie.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And dwell not on the suffering and sin, for they are but reflections of their cause.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The part you play in salvaging the world from condemnation is your own escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Forget not that the witness to the world of evil cannot speak except for what has seen a need for evil in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this is where your guilt was first beheld.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In separation from your brother was the first attack upon yourself begun.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is this the world bears witness to.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Seek not another cause, nor look among the mighty legions of its witnesses for its undoing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They support its claim on your allegiance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What conceals the truth is not where you should look to <i>find</i> the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The witnesses to sin all stand within one little space.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it is here you find the cause of your perspective on the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Once you were unaware of what the cause of everything the world appeared to thrust upon you, uninvited and unasked, must really be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Of one thing you were sure: Of all the many causes you perceived as bringing pain and suffering to you, your guilt was not among them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor did you in any way request them for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is how all illusions came about.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The one who makes them does not see himself as making them, and their reality does not depend on him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Whatever cause they have is something quite apart from him, and what he sees is separate from his mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He cannot doubt his dreams’ reality, because he does not see the part he plays in making them and making them seem real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can waken from a dream the world is dreaming for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He becomes a part of someone else’s dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He cannot choose to waken from a dream he did not make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Helpless he stands, a victim to a dream conceived and cherished by a separate mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Careless indeed of him this mind must be, as thoughtless of his peace and happiness as is the weather or the time of day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It loves him not, but casts him as it will in any role that satisfies its dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>So little is his worth that he is but a dancing shadow, leaping up and down according to a senseless plot conceived within the idle dreaming of the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the only picture you can see; the one alternative that you can choose, the other possibility of cause, if you be not the dreamer of your dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this is what you choose if you deny the cause of suffering is in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Be glad indeed it is, for thus are you the one decider of your destiny in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The choice is yours to make between a sleeping death and dreams of evil or a happy wakening and joy of life.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What could you choose between but life or death, waking or sleeping, peace or war, your dreams or your reality?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is a risk of thinking death is peace, because the world equates the body with the Self which God created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet a thing can never be its opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And death is opposite to peace, because it is the opposite of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And life is peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Awaken and forget all thoughts of death, and you will find you have the peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet if the choice is really given you, then you must see the causes of the things you choose between exactly as they are and where they are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What choices can be made between two states, but one of which is clearly recognized?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who could be free to choose between effects, when only one is seen as up to him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>An honest choice could never be perceived as one in which the choice is split between a tiny you and an enormous world, with different dreams about the truth in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The gap between reality and dreams lies not between the dreaming of the world and what you dream in secret.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The dreaming of the world is but a part of your own dream you gave away, and saw as if it were its start and ending, both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet was it started by your secret dream, which you do not perceive although it caused the part you see and do not doubt is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How could you doubt it while you lie asleep, and dream in secret that its cause is real?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A brother separated from yourself, an ancient enemy, a murderer who stalks you in the night and plots your death, yet plans that it be lingering and slow; of this you dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet underneath this dream is yet another, in which you become the murderer, the secret enemy, the scavenger and the destroyer of your brother and the world alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here is the cause of suffering, the space between your little dreams and your reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The little gap you do not even see, the birthplace of illusions and of fear, the time of terror and of ancient hate, the instant of disaster, all are here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here is the cause of unreality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And it is here that it will be undone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span><i>You</i> are the dreamer of the world of dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No other cause it has, nor ever will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing more fearful than an idle dream has terrified God’s Son, and made him think that he has lost his innocence, denied his Father, and made war upon himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>So fearful is the dream, so seeming real, he could not waken to reality without the sweat of terror and a scream of mortal fear, unless a gentler dream preceded his awaking, and allowed his calmer mind to welcome, not to fear, the Voice that calls with love to waken him; a gentler dream, in which his suffering was healed and where his brother was his friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God willed he waken gently and with joy, and gave him means to waken without fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Accept the dream He gave instead of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not difficult to change a dream when once the dreamer has been recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Rest in the Holy Spirit, and allow His gentle dreams to take the place of those you dreamed in terror and in fear of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He brings forgiving dreams, in which the choice is not who is the murderer and who shall be the victim.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In the dreams He brings there is no murder and there is no death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The dream of guilt is fading from your sight, although your eyes are closed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>A smile has come to lighten up your sleeping face.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The sleep is peaceful now, for these are happy dreams.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"312#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Dream softly of your sinless brother, who unites with you in holy innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And from this dream the Lord of Heaven will Himself awaken His beloved Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Dream of your brother’s kindnesses instead of dwelling in your dreams on his mistakes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Select his thoughtfulness to dream about instead of counting up the hurts he gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forgive him his illusions, and give thanks to him for all the helpfulness he gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And do not brush aside his many gifts because he is not perfect in your dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"312#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He represents his Father, Whom you see as offering both life and death to you.</span></p></div> <div
