26"},"annotation":"W-26","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text lesson-26\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"428#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is surely obvious that if you can be attacked you are not invulnerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You see attack as a real threat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is because you believe that you can really attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what would have effects through you must also have effects on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this law that will ultimately save you, but you are misusing it now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You must therefore learn how it can be used for your own best interests, rather than against them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"428#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Because your attack thoughts will be projected, you will fear attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And if you fear attack, you must believe that you are not invulnerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Attack thoughts therefore make you vulnerable in your own mind, which is where the attack thoughts are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Attack thoughts and invulnerability cannot be accepted together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They contradict each other.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"428#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea for today introduces the thought that you always attack yourself first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If attack thoughts must entail the belief that you are vulnerable, their effect is to weaken you in your own eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus they have attacked your perception of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And because you believe in them, you can no longer believe in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A false image of yourself has come to take the place of what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"428#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Practice with today‚Äôs idea will help you to understand that vulnerability or invulnerability is the result of your own thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothing except your thoughts can attack you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing except your thoughts can make you think you are vulnerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And nothing except your thoughts can prove to you this is not so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"428#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Six practice periods are required in applying today‚Äôs idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A full two minutes should be attempted for each of them, although the time may be reduced to a minute if the discomfort is too great.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not reduce it further.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"428#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The practice period should begin with repeating the idea for today, then closing your eyes and reviewing the unresolved questions whose outcomes are causing you concern.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The concern may take the form of depression, worry, anger, a sense of imposition, fear, foreboding or preoccupation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Any problem as yet unsettled that tends to recur in your thoughts during the day is a suitable subject.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will not be able to use very many for any one practice period, because a longer time than usual should be spent with each one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Today‚Äôs idea should be applied as follows:</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"428#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>First, name the situation:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"428#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I am concerned about _________.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"428#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then go over every possible outcome that has occurred to you in that connection and which has caused you concern, referring to each one quite specifically, saying:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"428#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am afraid _________ will happen.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"428#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are doing the exercises properly, you should have some five or six distressing possibilities available for each situation you use, and quite possibly more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is much more helpful to cover a few situations thoroughly than to touch on a larger number.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As the list of anticipated outcomes for each situation continues, you will probably find some of them, especially those that occur to you toward the end, less acceptable to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Try, however, to treat them all alike to whatever extent you can.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"428#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"428#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>After you have named each outcome of which you are afraid, tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"428#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That thought is an attack upon myself.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"428#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Conclude each practice period by repeating today‚Äôs idea to yourself once more.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is surely obvious that if you can be attacked you are not invulnerable.
