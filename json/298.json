translates the world of sin into a simple world, where justice can be reflected from beyond the gate behind which total lack of limits lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing in boundless love could need forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what is charity within the world gives way to simple justice past the gate that opens into Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one forgives unless he has believed in sin, and still believes that he has much to be forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Forgiveness thus becomes the means by which he learns he has done nothing to forgive.</span> <span

of glory, wonderful to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each flower shines in light, and every bird sings of the joy of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no sadness and there is no parting here, for everything is totally forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what has been forgiven must join, for nothing stands between to keep them separate and apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The sinless must perceive that they are one, for nothing stands between to push the other off.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in the space that sin left vacant do they join as one, in gladness recognizing what is part of them has not been kept apart and separate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"298#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

behold the face of Christ and not recall His Father as He really is?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who could fear love, and stand upon the ground where sin has left a place for Heaven’s altar to rise and tower far above the world, and reach beyond the universe to touch the Heart of all creation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is Heaven but a song of gratitude and love and praise by everything created to the Source of its creation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#3:6\"><span

be rekindled and increased in joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For here is what was lost restored to them, and all their radiance made whole again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"298#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness brings no little miracles to lay before the gate of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here the Son of God Himself comes to receive each gift that brings him nearer to his home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Not one is lost, and none is cherished more than any other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#4:4\"><span

loves the most.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What but a miracle could change his mind, so that he understands that love cannot be feared?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What other miracle is there but this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And what else need there be to make the space between you disappear?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"298#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#5:1\"><span class=\"snr

praise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And as they come to you to be complete, so will you go with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#5:3\"><span

class=\"snr\">4</span>And each one joins the singing at the altar that was raised within the tiny spot that sin proclaimed to be its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what was tiny then has soared into a magnitude of song in which the universe has joined with but a single voice.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"298#6\"><p

back the happy opening of Heaven’s gate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How little is the hindrance that withholds the wealth of Heaven from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"298#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And how great will be the joy in Heaven when you join the mighty chorus to the Love of God!</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Forgiveness
