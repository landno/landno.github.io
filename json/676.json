‚Äúproof‚Äù his fences work, and do the task his mind assigns to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"676#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For if his oneness still remained untouched, who could

data-sentence-id=\"676#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For only love creates in truth, and truth can never fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"676#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Made to be fearful, must the body serve the purpose given it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"676#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But we can change the purpose that the body will obey by changing what we think

the means by which God‚Äôs Son returns to sanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"676#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Though it was made to fence him into hell without escape, yet has the goal of Heaven been exchanged for the pursuit of hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"676#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Son of God extends his hand to reach his brother, and to help him walk along the road with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"676#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now is the body holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"676#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now it serves to
