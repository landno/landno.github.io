data-sentence-id=\"344#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>An ancient lesson is not overcome by the opposing of the new and old.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not vanquished that the truth be known, nor fought against to lose to truth’s appeal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no battle that must be prepared; no time to be expended, and no plans that need be laid for bringing in the new.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There <i>is</i> an ancient battle being waged against the truth, but truth does not respond.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who could be hurt in such a war, unless he hurts himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He has no enemy in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And can he be assailed by dreams?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us review again what seems to stand between you and the truth of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For there are steps in its relinquishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The first is a decision that you make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But afterwards, the truth is given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You would establish truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And by your wish you set two choices to be made, each time you think you must decide on anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Neither is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nor are they different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet must we see them both, before you can look past them to the one alternative that <i>is</i> a different choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But not in dreams you made, that this might be obscured to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What you would choose between is not a choice and gives but the illusion it is free, for it will have one outcome either way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Thus is it really not a choice at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The leader and the follower emerge as separate roles, each seeming to possess advantages you would not want to lose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>So in their fusion there appears to be the hope of satisfaction and of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You see yourself divided into both these roles, forever split between the two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And every friend or enemy becomes a means to help you save yourself from this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps you call it love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you think that it is murder justified at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You hate the one you gave the leader’s role when you would have it, and you hate as well his not assuming it at times you want to let the follower in you arise, and give away the role of leadership.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And this is what you made your brother for, and learned to think that this his purpose is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Unless he serves it, he has not fulfilled the function that was given him by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And thus he merits death, because he has no purpose and no usefulness to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And what of him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What does he want of you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What could he want, but what you want of him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Herein is life as easily as death, for what you choose you choose as well for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Two calls you make to him, as he to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Between these two <i>is</i> choice, because from them there is a different outcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If he be the leader or the follower to you it matters not, for you have chosen death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But if he calls for death or calls for life, for hate or for forgiveness and for help, is not the same in outcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Hear the one, and you are separate from him and are lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But hear the other, and you join with him and in your answer is salvation found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The voice you hear in him is but your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>What does he ask you for?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>And listen well!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#5:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>For he is asking what will come to you, because you see an image of yourself and hear your voice requesting what you want.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Before you answer, pause to think of this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"344#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The answer that I give my brother is what I am asking for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what I learn of him is what I learn about myself.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"344#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then let us wait an instant and be still, forgetting everything we thought we heard; remembering how much we do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This brother neither leads nor follows us, but walks beside us on the selfsame road.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is like us, as near or far away from what we want as we will let him be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>We make no gains he does not make with us, and we fall back if he does not advance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Take not his hand in anger but in love, for in his progress do you count your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And we go separately along the way unless you keep him safely by your side.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Because he is your equal in God’s Love, you will be saved from all appearances and answer to the Christ Who calls to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be still and listen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think not ancient thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Forget the dismal lessons that you learned about this Son of God who calls to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Christ calls to all with equal tenderness, seeing no leaders and no followers, and hearing but one answer to them all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Because He hears one Voice, He cannot hear a different answer from the one He gave when God appointed Him His only Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be very still an instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Come without all thought of what you ever learned before, and put aside all images you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The old will fall away before the new without your opposition or intent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There will be no attack upon the things you thought were precious and in need of care.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There will be no assault upon your wish to hear a call that never has been made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing will hurt you in this holy place, to which you come to listen silently and learn the truth of what you really want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No more than this will you be asked to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But as you hear it, you will understand you need but come away without the thoughts you did not want, and that were never true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgive your brother all appearances, that are but ancient lessons you have taught yourself about the sinfulness in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Hear but his call for mercy and release from all the fearful images he holds of what he is and of what you must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is afraid to walk with you, and thinks perhaps a bit behind, a bit ahead would be a safer place for him to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Can you make progress if you think the same, advancing only when he would step back, and falling back when he would go ahead?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For so do you forget the journey’s goal, which is but to decide to walk with him, so neither leads nor follows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thus it is a way you go together, not alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in this choice is learning’s outcome changed, for Christ has been reborn to both of you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>An instant spent without your old ideas of who your great companion is and what he should be asking for, will be enough to let this happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you will perceive his purpose is the same as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He asks for what you want, and needs the same as you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It takes, perhaps, a different form in him, but it is not the form you answer to.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He asks and you receive, for you have come with but one purpose; that you learn you love your brother with a brother’s love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And as a brother, must his Father be the same as yours, as he is like yourself in truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"344#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Together is your joint inheritance remembered and accepted by you both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Alone it is denied to both of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is it not clear that while you still insist on leading or on following, you think you walk alone, with no one by your side?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the road to nowhere, for the light cannot be given while you walk alone, and so you cannot see which way you go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus there is confusion, and a sense of endless doubting as you stagger back and forward in the darkness and alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet these are but appearances of what the journey is, and how it must be made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For next to you is One Who holds the light before you, so that every step is made in certainty and sureness of the road.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>A blindfold can indeed obscure your sight, but cannot make the way itself grow dark.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"344#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And He Who travels with you <i>has</i> the light.</span></p></div>
