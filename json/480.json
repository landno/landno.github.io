class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are entitled to miracles because of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will receive miracles because of what God is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you will offer miracles because you are one with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Again, how simple is salvation!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is merely a statement of your true Identity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is this that we will celebrate today.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"480#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your claim to miracles does not lie in your illusions about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not depend on any magical powers you have ascribed to yourself, nor on any of the rituals you have devised.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is inherent in the truth of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is implicit in what God your Father is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It was ensured in your creation, and guaranteed by the laws of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"480#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we will claim the miracles which are your right, since they belong to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have been promised full release from the world you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have been assured that the Kingdom of God is within you, and can never be lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We ask no more than what belongs to us in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Today, however, we will also make sure that we will not content ourselves with less.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"480#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin the longer practice periods by telling yourself quite confidently that you are entitled to miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Closing your eyes, remind yourself that you are asking only for what is rightfully yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remind yourself also that miracles are never taken from one and given to another, and that in asking for your rights, you are upholding the rights of everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Miracles do not obey the laws of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They merely follow from the laws of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"480#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>After this brief introductory phase, wait quietly for the assurance that your request is granted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have asked for the salvation of the world, and for your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have requested that you be given the means by which this is accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot fail to be assured in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are but asking that the Will of God be done.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"480#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In doing this, you do not really ask for anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You state a fact that cannot be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit cannot but assure you that your request is granted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The fact that you accepted must be so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no room for doubt and uncertainty today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We are asking a real question at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The answer is a simple statement of a simple fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You will receive the assurance that you seek.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"480#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our shorter practice periods will be frequent, and will also be devoted to a reminder of a simple fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Tell yourself often today:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"480#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I am entitled to miracles.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"480#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Ask for them whenever a situation arises in which they are called for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will recognize these situations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And since you are not relying on yourself to find the miracle, you are fully entitled to receive it whenever you ask.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"480#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember, too, not to be satisfied with less than the perfect answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be quick to tell yourself, should you be tempted:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"480#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I will not trade miracles for grievances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I want only what belongs to me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"480#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God has established miracles as my right.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You are entitled to
