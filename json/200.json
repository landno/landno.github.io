Sacrifice","inlineNumber":"XI."},"annotation":"T-15.XI","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-15-sect-11\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Fear not to recognize the whole idea of sacrifice as solely of your making.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And seek not safety by attempting to protect yourself from where it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your brothers and your Father have become very fearful to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you would bargain with them for a few special relationships, in which you think you see some scraps of safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not try longer to keep apart your thoughts and the Thought that has been given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When they are brought together and perceived where they are, the choice between them is nothing more than a gentle awakening, and as simple as opening your eyes to daylight when you have no more need of sleep.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The sign of Christmas is a star, a light in darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>See it not outside yourself, but shining in the Heaven within, and accept it as the sign the time of Christ has come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He comes demanding nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No sacrifice of any kind, of anyone, is asked by Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In His Presence the whole idea of sacrifice loses all meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For He is Host to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you need but invite Him in Who is there already, by recognizing that His Host is One, and no thought alien to His Oneness can abide with Him there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Love must be total to give Him welcome, for the Presence of Holiness creates the holiness that surrounds it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>No fear can touch the Host Who cradles God in the time of Christ, for the Host is as holy as the perfect Innocence which He protects, and Whose power protects Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This Christmas give the Holy Spirit everything that would hurt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let yourself be healed completely that you may join with Him in healing, and let us celebrate our release together by releasing everyone with us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Leave nothing behind, for release is total, and when you have accepted it with me you will give it with me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All pain and sacrifice and littleness will disappear in our relationship, which is as innocent as our relationship with our Father, and as powerful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Pain will be brought to us and disappear in our presence, and without pain there can be no sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And without sacrifice there love <i>must</i> be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who believe that sacrifice is love must learn that sacrifice is separation from love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For sacrifice brings guilt as surely as love brings peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Guilt is the condition of sacrifice, as peace is the condition for the awareness of your relationship with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Through guilt you exclude your Father and your brothers from yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Through peace you invite them back, realizing that they are where your invitation bids them be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What you exclude from yourself seems fearful, for you endow it with fear and try to cast it out, though it is part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who can perceive part of himself as loathsome, and live within himself in peace?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And who can try to resolve the “conflict” of Heaven and hell in him by casting Heaven out and giving it the attributes of hell, without experiencing himself as incomplete and lonely?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As long as you perceive the body as your reality, so long will you perceive yourself as lonely and deprived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so long will you also perceive yourself as a victim of sacrifice, justified in sacrificing others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For who could thrust Heaven and its Creator aside without a sense of sacrifice and loss?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And who could suffer sacrifice and loss without attempting to restore himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet how could you accomplish this yourself, when the basis of your attempts is the belief in the reality of the deprivation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Deprivation breeds attack, being the belief that attack is justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And as long as you would retain the deprivation, attack becomes salvation and sacrifice becomes love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>So is it that, in all your seeking for love, you seek for sacrifice and find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you find not love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is impossible to deny what love is and still recognize it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The meaning of love lies in what you have cast outside yourself, and it has no meaning apart from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is what you prefer to keep that has no meaning, while all that you would keep away holds all the meaning of the universe, and holds the universe together in its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Unless the universe were joined in you it would be apart from God, and to be without Him <i>is</i> to be without meaning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the holy instant the condition of love is met, for minds are joined without the body’s interference, and where there is communication there is peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Prince of Peace was born to re-establish the condition of love by teaching that communication remains unbroken even if the body is destroyed, provided that you see not the body as the necessary means of communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And if you understand this lesson, you will realize that to sacrifice the body is to sacrifice nothing, and communication, which must be of the mind, cannot be sacrificed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where, then, <i>is</i> sacrifice?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The lesson I was born to teach, and still would teach to all my brothers, is that sacrifice is nowhere and love is everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For communication embraces everything, and in the peace it re-establishes, love comes of itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let no despair darken the joy of Christmas, for the time of Christ is meaningless apart from joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us join in celebrating peace by demanding no sacrifice of anyone, for so you offer me the love I offer you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What can be more joyous than to perceive we are deprived of nothing?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Such is the message of the time of Christ, which I give you that you may give it and return it to the Father, Who gave it to me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For in the time of Christ communication is restored, and He joins us in the celebration of His Son’s creation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God offers thanks to the holy host who would receive Him, and lets Him enter and abide where He would be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And by your welcome does He welcome you into Himself, for what is contained in you who welcome Him is returned to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And we but celebrate His Wholeness as we welcome Him into ourselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Those who receive the Father are one with Him, being host to Him Who created them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And by allowing Him to enter, the remembrance of the Father enters with Him, and with Him they remember the only relationship they ever had, and ever want to have.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"200#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the time in which a new year will soon be born from the time of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I have perfect faith in you to do all that you would accomplish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing will be lacking, and you will make complete and not destroy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Say, then, to your brother:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I give you to the Holy Spirit as part of myself.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I know that you will be released, unless I want to use you to imprison myself.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In the name of my freedom I choose your release, because I recognize that we will be released together.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>So will the year begin in joy and freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There is much to do, and we have been long delayed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Accept the holy instant as this year is born, and take your place, so long left unfulfilled, in the Great Awakening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Make this year different by making it all the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And let all your relationships be made holy for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>This is our will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"200#10:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>Amen.</span></p></div>
