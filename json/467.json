class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today‚Äôs idea is merely another way of saying ‚ÄúLet me not wander into temptation.‚Äù</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The purpose of the world you see is to obscure your function of forgiveness, and provide you with a justification for forgetting it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the temptation to abandon God and His Son by taking on a physical appearance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is this the body‚Äôs eyes look upon.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"467#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing the body‚Äôs eyes seem to see can be anything but a form of temptation, since this was the purpose of the body itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet we have learned that the Holy Spirit has another use for all the illusions you have made, and therefore He sees another purpose in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To the Holy Spirit, the world is a place where you learn to forgive yourself what you think of as your sins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In this perception, the physical appearance of temptation becomes the spiritual recognition of salvation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"467#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To review our last few lessons, your function here is to be the light of the world, a function given you by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is only the arrogance of the ego that leads you to question this, and only the fear of the ego that induces you to regard yourself as unworthy of the task assigned to you by God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world‚Äôs salvation awaits your forgiveness, because through it does the Son of God escape from all illusions, and thus from all temptation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Son of God is you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"467#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only by fulfilling the function given you by God will you be happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is because your function is to be happy by using the means by which happiness becomes inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no other way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore, every time you choose whether or not to fulfill your function, you are really choosing whether or not to be happy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"467#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us remember this today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us remind ourselves of it in the morning and again at night, and all through the day as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Prepare yourself in advance for all the decisions you will make today by remembering they are all really very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each one will lead to happiness or unhappiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can such a simple decision really be difficult to make?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let not the form of the decision deceive you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Complexity of form does not imply complexity of content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is impossible that any decision on earth can have a content different from just this one simple choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That is the only choice the Holy Spirit sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Therefore it is the only choice there is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"467#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today, then, let us practice with these thoughts:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"467#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let me not forget my function.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let me not try to substitute mine for God‚Äôs.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let me forgive and be happy.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"467#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>At least once devote ten or fifteen minutes today to reflecting on this with closed eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Related thoughts will come to help you, if you remember the crucial importance of your function to you and to the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"467#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the frequent applications of today‚Äôs idea throughout the day, devote several minutes to reviewing these thoughts, and then thinking about them and about nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This will be difficult, at first particularly, since you are not proficient in the mind discipline that it requires.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You may need to repeat ‚ÄúLet me not forget my function‚Äù quite often to help you concentrate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"467#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Two forms of shorter practice periods are required.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>At times, do the exercises with your eyes closed, trying to concentrate on the thoughts you are using.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"467#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>At other times, keep your eyes open after reviewing the thoughts, and then look slowly and unselectively around you, telling yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"467#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the world it is my function to save.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today‚Äôs idea is merely another way of saying ‚ÄúLet me
