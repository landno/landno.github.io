data-sentence-id=\"117#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit will always guide you truly, because your joy is His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is His Will for everyone because He speaks for the Kingdom of God, which <i>is</i> joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Following Him is therefore the easiest thing in the world, and the only thing that is easy, because it is not of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is therefore natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The world goes against your nature, being out of accord with God’s laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The world perceives orders of difficulty in everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is because the ego perceives nothing as wholly desirable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>By demonstrating to yourself there is no order of difficulty in miracles, you will convince yourself that, in your natural state, there is no difficulty at all <i>because</i> it is a state of grace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"117#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Grace is the natural state of every Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When he is not in a state of grace, he is out of his natural environment and does not function well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Everything he does becomes a strain, because he was not created for the environment that he has made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He therefore cannot adapt to it, nor can he adapt it to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no point in trying.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A Son of God is happy only when he knows he is with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is the only environment in which he will not experience strain, because that is where he belongs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is also the only environment that is worthy of him, because his own worth is beyond anything he can make.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"117#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Consider the kingdom you have made and judge its worth fairly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is it worthy to be a home for a child of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Does it protect his peace and shine love upon him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Does it keep his heart untouched by fear, and allow him to give always, without any sense of loss?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Does it teach him that this giving is his joy, and that God Himself thanks him for his giving?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is the only environment in which you can be happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You cannot make it, any more than you can make yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It has been created for you, as you were created for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>God watches over His children and denies them nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet when they deny Him they do not know this, because they deny themselves everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You who could give the Love of God to everything you see and touch and remember, are literally denying Heaven to yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"117#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I call upon you to remember that I have chosen you to teach the Kingdom <i>to</i> the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There are no exceptions to this lesson, because the lack of exceptions <i>is</i> the lesson.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every Son who returns to the Kingdom with this lesson in his heart has healed the Sonship and given thanks to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everyone who learns this lesson has become the perfect teacher, because he has learned it of the Holy Spirit.</span></p></div> <div

light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its own radiance shines all around it, and extends out into the darkness of other minds, transforming them into majesty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Majesty of God is there, for you to recognize and appreciate and know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Recognizing the Majesty of God as your brother is to accept your own inheritance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God gives only equally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you recognize His gift in anyone, you have acknowledged what He has given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing is so easy to recognize as truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is the recognition that is immediate, clear and natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You have trained yourself not to recognize it, and this has been very difficult for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"117#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Out of your natural environment you may well ask, “What is truth?” since truth is the environment by which and for which you were created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not know yourself, because you do not know your Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not know your creations because you do not know your brothers, who created them with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I have already said that only the whole Sonship is worthy to be co-creator with God, because only the whole Sonship can create like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Whenever you heal a brother by recognizing his worth, you are acknowledging his power to create and yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He cannot have lost what you recognize, and you must have the glory you see in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He is a co-creator with God with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Deny his creative power, and you are denying yours and that of God Who created you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"117#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot deny part of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not know your creations because you do not know their creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not know yourself because you do not know yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your creations cannot establish your reality, any more than you can establish God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But you can <i>know</i> both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Being is known by sharing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Because God shared His Being with you, you can know Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But you must also know all He created, to know what they have shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Without your Father you will not know your fatherhood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The Kingdom of God includes all His Sons and their children, who are as like the Sons as they are like the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"117#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Know, then, the Sons of God, and you will know all creation.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The Holy Spirit will always guide you truly, because your joy is His.
