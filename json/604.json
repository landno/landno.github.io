data-sentence-id=\"604#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When this is firmly understood and kept in full awareness, you will not attempt to harm yourself, nor make your body slave to vengeance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will not attack yourself, and you will realize that to attack another is but to attack yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will be free of the insane belief that to attack a brother saves yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will understand his safety is your own, and in his healing you are healed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps at first you will not understand how mercy, limitless and with all things held in its sure protection, can be found in the idea we practice for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It may, in fact, appear to be a sign that punishment can never be escaped because the ego, under what it sees as threat, is quick to cite the truth to save its lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet must it fail to understand the truth it uses thus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But you can learn to see these foolish applications, and deny the meaning they appear to have.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus do you also teach your mind that you are not an ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the ways in which the ego would distort the truth will not deceive you longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will not believe you are a body to be crucified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will see within today’s idea the light of resurrection, looking past all thoughts of crucifixion and of death, to thoughts of liberation and of life.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today’s idea is one step we take in leading us from bondage to the state of perfect freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us take this step today, that we may quickly go the way salvation shows us, taking every step in its appointed sequence, as the mind relinquishes its burdens one by one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not time we need for this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is but willingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For what would seem to need a thousand years can easily be done in just one instant by the grace of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The dreary, hopeless thought that you can make attacks on others and escape yourself has nailed you to the cross.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps it seemed to be salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it merely stood for the belief the fear of God is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what is that but hell?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who could believe his Father is his deadly enemy, separate from him, and waiting to destroy his life and blot him from the universe, without the fear of hell upon his heart?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is the form of madness you believe, if you accept the fearful thought you can attack another and be free yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Until this form is changed, there is no hope.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Until you see that this, at least, must be entirely impossible, how could there be escape?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The fear of God is real to anyone who thinks this thought is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And he will not perceive its foolishness, or even see that it is there, so that it would be possible to question it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To question it at all, its form must first be changed at least as much as will permit fear of retaliation to abate, and the responsibility returned to some extent to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From there you can at least consider if you want to go along this painful path.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Until this shift has been accomplished, you can not perceive that it is but your thoughts that bring you fear, and your deliverance depends on you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our next steps will be easy, if you take this one today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From there we go ahead quite rapidly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For once you understand it is impossible that you be hurt except by your own thoughts, the fear of God must disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot then believe that fear is caused without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And God, Whom you had thought to banish, can be welcomed back within the holy mind He never left.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation’s song can certainly be heard in the idea we practice for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If it can but be you you crucify, you did not hurt the world, and need not fear its vengeance and pursuit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor need you hide in terror from the deadly fear of God projection hides behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The thing you dread the most is your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are strong, and it is strength you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you are free, and glad of freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have sought to be both weak and bound, because you feared your strength and freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet salvation lies in them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is an instant in which terror seems to grip your mind so wholly that escape appears quite hopeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you realize, once and for all, that it is you you fear, the mind perceives itself as split.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this had been concealed while you believed attack could be directed outward, and returned from outside to within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It seemed to be an enemy outside you had to fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus a god outside yourself became your mortal enemy; the source of fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now, for an instant, is a murderer perceived within you, eager for your death, intent on plotting punishment for you until the time when it can kill at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet in this instant is the time as well in which salvation comes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For fear of God has disappeared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you can call on Him to save you from illusions by His Love, calling Him Father and yourself His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Pray that the instant may be soon,—today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Step back from fear, and make advance to love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no Thought of God that does not go with you to help you reach that instant, and to go beyond it quickly, surely and forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When the fear of God is gone, there are no obstacles that still remain between you and the holy peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How kind and merciful is the idea we practice!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Give it welcome, as you should, for it is your release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is indeed but you your mind can try to crucify.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet your redemption, too, will come from you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"When this is firmly understood and
