data-sentence-id=\"203#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may still think that holiness is impossible to understand, because you cannot see how it can be extended to include everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you have been told that it must include everyone to <i>be</i> holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Concern yourself not with the extension of holiness, for the nature of miracles you do not understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor do you do them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is their extension, far beyond the limits you perceive, that demonstrates you do not do them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Why should you worry how the miracle extends to all the Sonship when you do not understand the miracle itself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>One attribute is no more difficult to understand than is the whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If miracles <i>are</i> at all, their attributes would have to be miraculous, being part of them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"203#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a tendency to fragment, and then to be concerned about the truth of just a little part of the whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this is but a way of avoiding, or looking away from the whole, to what you think you might be better able to understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For this is but another way in which you would still try to keep understanding to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A better and far more helpful way to think of miracles is this: You do not understand them, either in part or in whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet they have been done through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Therefore your understanding cannot be necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet it is still impossible to accomplish what you do not understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so there must be Something in you that <i>does</i> understand.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"203#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To you the miracle cannot seem natural, because what you have done to hurt your mind has made it so unnatural that it does not remember what is natural to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And when you are told what is natural, you cannot understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The recognition of the part as whole, and of the whole in every part is perfectly natural, for it is the way God thinks, and what is natural to Him is natural to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Wholly natural perception would show you instantly that order of difficulty in miracles is quite impossible, for it involves a contradiction of what miracles mean.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And if you could understand their meaning, their attributes could hardly cause you perplexity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"203#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have done miracles, but it is quite apparent that you have not done them alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have succeeded whenever you have reached another mind and joined with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When two minds join as one and share one idea equally, the first link in the awareness of the Sonship as one has been made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you have made this joining as the Holy Spirit bids you, and have offered it to Him to use as He sees fit, His natural perception of your gift enables Him to understand it, and you to use His understanding on your behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is impossible to convince you of the reality of what has clearly been accomplished through your willingness while you believe that you must understand it or else it is not real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"203#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can faith in reality be yours while you are bent on making it unreal?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And are you really safer in maintaining the reality of illusions than you would be in joyously accepting truth for what it is, and giving thanks for it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Honor the truth that has been given you, and be glad you do not understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Miracles are natural to the One Who speaks for God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For His task is to translate the miracle into the knowledge which it represents, and which is hidden to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let His understanding of the miracle be enough for you, and do not turn away from all the witnesses that He has given you to His reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"203#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No evidence will convince you of the truth of what you do not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet your relationship with Him is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Regard this not with fear, but with rejoicing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The One you called upon <i>is</i> with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Bid Him welcome, and honor the witnesses who bring you the glad tidings He has come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is true, just as you fear, that to acknowledge Him is to deny all that you think you know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But what you think you know was never true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What gain is there to you in clinging to it, and denying the evidence for truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For you have come too near to truth to renounce it now, and you <i>will</i> yield to its compelling attraction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You can delay this now, but only a little while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The Host of God has called to you, and you have heard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Never again will you be wholly willing not to listen.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"203#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is a year of joy, in which your listening will increase and peace will grow with its increase.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The power of holiness and the weakness of attack are both being brought into your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this has been accomplished in a mind firmly convinced that holiness is weakness and attack is power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Should not this be a sufficient miracle to teach you that your Teacher is not of you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But remember also that whenever you listened to His interpretation the results have brought you joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Would you prefer the results of your interpretation, considering honestly what they have been?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God wills you better.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Could you not look with greater charity on whom God loves with perfect Love?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"203#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not interpret against God’s Love, for you have many witnesses that speak of it so clearly that only the blind and deaf could fail to see and hear them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This year determine not to deny what has been given you by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Awake and share it, for that is the only reason He has called to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His Voice has spoken clearly, and yet you have so little faith in what you heard, because you have preferred to place still greater faith in the disaster you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Today, let us resolve together to accept the joyful tidings that disaster is not real and that reality is not disaster.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Reality is safe and sure, and wholly kind to everyone and everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no greater love than to accept this and be glad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For love asks only that you be happy, and will give you everything that makes for happiness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"203#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have never given any problem to the Holy Spirit He has not solved for you, nor will you ever do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have never tried to solve anything yourself and been successful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is it not time you brought these facts together and made sense of them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the year for the application of the ideas that have been given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the ideas are mighty forces, to be used and not held idly by.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They have already proved their power sufficiently for you to place your faith in them, and not in their denial.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This year invest in truth, and let it work in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Have faith in Him Who has faith in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Think what you have really seen and heard, and recognize it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"203#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Can you be alone with witnesses like these?</span></p></div>
