data-sentence-id=\"567#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we practice differently, and take a stand against our anger, that our fears may disappear and offer room to love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is salvation in the simple words in which we practice with today’s idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here is the answer to temptation which can never fail to welcome in the Christ where fear and anger had prevailed before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here is Atonement made complete, the world passed safely by and Heaven now restored.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here is the answer of the Voice for God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Complete abstraction is the natural condition of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But part of it is now unnatural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It does not look on everything as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It sees instead but fragments of the whole, for only thus could it invent the partial world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The purpose of all seeing is to show you what you wish to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All hearing but brings to your mind the sounds it wants to hear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus were specifics made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And now it is specifics we must use in practicing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We give them to the Holy Spirit, that He may employ them for a purpose which is different from the one we gave to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet He can use but what we made, to teach us from a different point of view, so we can see a different use in everything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>One brother is all brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every mind contains all minds, for every mind is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Such is the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet do these thoughts make clear the meaning of creation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do these words bring perfect clarity with them to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What can they seem to be but empty sounds; pretty, perhaps, correct in sentiment, yet fundamentally not understood nor understandable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The mind that taught itself to think specifically can no longer grasp abstraction in the sense that it is all-encompassing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>We need to see a little, that we learn a lot.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It seems to be the body that we feel limits our freedom, makes us suffer, and at last puts out our life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet bodies are but symbols for a concrete form of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fear without symbols calls for no response, for symbols can stand for the meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Love needs no symbols, being true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But fear attaches to specifics, being false.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Bodies attack, but minds do not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This thought is surely reminiscent of our text, where it is often emphasized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the reason bodies easily become fear’s symbols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have many times been urged to look beyond the body, for its sight presents the symbol of love’s “enemy” Christ’s vision does not see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The body is the target for attack, for no one thinks he hates a mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet what but mind directs the body to attack?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What else could be the seat of fear except what thinks of fear?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Hate is specific.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There must be a thing to be attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>An enemy must be perceived in such a form he can be touched and seen and heard, and ultimately killed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When hatred rests upon a thing, it calls for death as surely as God’s Voice proclaims there is no death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Fear is insatiable, consuming everything its eyes behold, seeing itself in everything, compelled to turn upon itself and to destroy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who sees a brother as a body sees him as fear’s symbol.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And he will attack, because what he beholds is his own fear external to himself, poised to attack, and howling to unite with him again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Mistake not the intensity of rage projected fear must spawn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It shrieks in wrath, and claws the air in frantic hope it can reach to its maker and devour him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This do the body’s eyes behold in one whom Heaven cherishes, the angels love and God created perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is his reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And in Christ’s vision is his loveliness reflected in a form so holy and so beautiful that you could scarce refrain from kneeling at his feet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you will take his hand instead, for you are like him in the sight that sees him thus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Attack on him is enemy to you, for you will not perceive that in his hands is your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ask him but for this, and he will give it to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Ask him not to symbolize your fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Would you request that love destroy itself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Or would you have it be revealed to you and set you free?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we practice in a form we have attempted earlier.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your readiness is closer now, and you will come today nearer Christ’s vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you are intent on reaching it, you will succeed today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And once you have succeeded, you will not be willing to accept the witnesses your body’s eyes call forth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you will see will sing to you of ancient melodies you will remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are not forgot in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Would you not remember it?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Select one brother, symbol of the rest, and ask salvation of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>See him first as clearly as you can, in that same form to which you are accustomed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>See his face, his hands and feet, his clothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Watch him smile, and see familiar gestures which he makes so frequently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Then think of this: What you are seeing now conceals from you the sight of one who can forgive you all your sins; whose sacred hands can take away the nails which pierce your own, and lift the crown of thorns which you have placed upon your bleeding head.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ask this of him, that he may set you free:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"567#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Give me your blessing, holy Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I would behold you with the eyes of Christ, and see my perfect sinlessness in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And He will answer Whom you called upon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For He will hear the Voice for God in you, and answer in your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Behold him now, whom you have seen as merely flesh and bone, and recognize that Christ has come to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Today’s idea is your safe escape from anger and from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be sure you use it instantly, should you be tempted to attack a brother and perceive in him the symbol of your fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will see him suddenly transformed from enemy to savior; from the devil into Christ.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today we practice differently, and take a stand against our anger, that our fears may
