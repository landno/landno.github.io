data-sentence-id=\"217#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant is nothing more than a special case, or an extreme example, of what every situation is meant to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The meaning that the Holy Spirit’s purpose has given it is also given to every situation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It calls forth just the same suspension of faithlessness, withheld and left unused, that faith might answer to the call of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The holy instant is the shining example, the clear and unequivocal demonstration of the meaning of every relationship and every situation, seen as a whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Faith has accepted every aspect of the situation, and faithlessness has not forced any exclusion on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is a situation of perfect peace, simply because you have let it be what it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"217#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This simple courtesy is all the Holy Spirit asks of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let truth be what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not intrude upon it, do not attack it, do not interrupt its coming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let it encompass every situation and bring you peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Not even faith is asked of you, for truth asks nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let it enter, and it will call forth and secure for you the faith you need for peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But rise you not against it, for against your opposition it cannot come.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"217#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you not want to make a holy instant of every situation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For such is the gift of faith, freely given wherever faithlessness is laid aside, unused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And then the power of the Holy Spirit’s purpose is free to use instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This power instantly transforms all situations into one sure and continuous means for establishing His purpose, and demonstrating its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What has been demonstrated has called for faith, and has been given it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Now it becomes a fact, from which faith can no longer be withheld.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The strain of refusing faith to truth is enormous, and far greater than you realize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But to answer truth with faith entails no strain at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"217#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To you who have acknowledged the Call of your Redeemer, the strain of not responding to His Call seems to be greater than before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Before, the strain was there, but you attributed it to something else, believing that the “something else” produced it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This was never true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For what the “something else” produced was sorrow and depression, sickness and pain, darkness and dim imaginings of terror, cold fantasies of fear and fiery dreams of hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And it was nothing but the intolerable strain of refusing to give faith to truth, and see its evident reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"217#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such was the crucifixion of the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His faithlessness did this to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think carefully before you let yourself use faithlessness against him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For he is risen, and you have accepted the Cause of his awakening as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have assumed your part in his redemption, and you are now fully responsible to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Fail him not now, for it has been given you to realize what your lack of faith in him must mean to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His salvation is your only purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>See only this in every situation, and it will be a means for bringing only this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"217#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you accepted truth as the goal for your relationship, you became a giver of peace as surely as your Father gave peace to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the goal of peace cannot be accepted apart from its conditions, and you had faith in it for no one accepts what he does not believe is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your purpose has not changed, and will not change, for you accepted what can never change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And nothing that it needs to be forever changeless can you now withhold from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your release is certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Give as you have received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"217#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And demonstrate that you have risen far beyond any situation that could hold you back, and keep you separate from Him Whose Call you answered.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The holy instant is nothing more than a special case, or an extreme example, of what every situation is meant to be.
