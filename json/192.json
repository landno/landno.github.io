<span data-sentence-id=\"192#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be not content with littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But be sure you understand what littleness is, and why you could never be content with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Littleness is the offering you give yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You offer this in place of magnitude, and you accept it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everything in this world is little because it is a world made out of littleness, in the strange belief that littleness can content you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you strive for anything in this world in the belief that it will bring you peace, you are belittling yourself and blinding yourself to glory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Littleness and glory are the choices open to your striving and your vigilance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You will always choose one at the expense of the other.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet what you do not realize, each time you choose, is that your choice is your evaluation of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Choose littleness and you will not have peace, for you will have judged yourself unworthy of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And whatever you offer as a substitute is much too poor a gift to satisfy you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is essential that you accept the fact, and accept it gladly, that there is no form of littleness that can ever content you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are free to try as many as you wish, but all you will be doing is to delay your homecoming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For you will be content only in magnitude, which is your home.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a deep responsibility you owe yourself, and one you must learn to remember all the time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The lesson may seem hard at first, but you will learn to love it when you realize that it is true and is but a tribute to your power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You who have sought and found littleness, remember this: Every decision you make stems from what you think you are, and represents the value that you put upon yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Believe the little can content you, and by limiting yourself you will not be satisfied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For your function is not little, and it is only by finding your function and fulfilling it that you can escape from littleness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no doubt about what your function is, for the Holy Spirit knows what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no doubt about its magnitude, for it reaches you through Him <i>from</i> Magnitude.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not have to strive for it, because you have it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All your striving must be directed against littleness, for it does require vigilance to protect your magnitude in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To hold your magnitude in perfect awareness in a world of littleness is a task the little cannot undertake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it is asked of you, in tribute to your magnitude and not your littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor is it asked of you alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The power of God will support every effort you make on behalf of His dear Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Search for the little, and you deny yourself His power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God is not willing that His Son be content with less than everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>For He is not content without His Son, and His Son cannot be content with less than his Father has given him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I asked you earlier, “Would you be hostage to the ego or host to God?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let this question be asked you by the Holy Spirit every time you make a decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For every decision you make does answer this, and invites sorrow or joy accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When God gave Himself to you in your creation, He established you as host to Him forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has not left you, and you have not left Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All your attempts to deny His magnitude, and make His Son hostage to the ego, cannot make little whom God has joined with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Every decision you make is for Heaven or for hell, and brings you the awareness of what you decided for.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit can hold your magnitude, clean of all littleness, clearly and in perfect safety in your mind, untouched by every little gift the world of littleness would offer you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But for this, you cannot side against Him in what He wills for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Decide for God through Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For littleness, and the belief that you can be content with littleness, are decisions you make about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The power and the glory that lie in you from God are for all who, like you, perceive themselves as little, and believe that littleness can be blown up into a sense of magnitude that can content them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Neither give littleness, nor accept it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All honor is due the host of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your littleness deceives you, but your magnitude is of Him Who dwells in you, and in Whom you dwell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Touch no one, then, with littleness in the Name of Christ, eternal Host unto His Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this season (Christmas) which celebrates the birth of holiness into this world, join with me who decided for holiness for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is our task together to restore the awareness of magnitude to the host whom God appointed for Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is beyond all your littleness to give the gift of God, but not beyond you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For God would give Himself <i>through</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He reaches from you to everyone and beyond everyone to His Son’s creations, but without leaving you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Far beyond your little world but still in you, He extends forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet He brings all His extensions to you, as host to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is it a sacrifice to leave littleness behind, and wander not in vain?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not sacrifice to wake to glory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But it is sacrifice to accept anything less than glory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Learn that you must be worthy of the Prince of Peace, born in you in honor of Him Whose host you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You know not what love means because you have sought to purchase it with little gifts, thus valuing it too little to understand its magnitude.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Love is not little and love dwells in you, for you are host to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Before the greatness that lives in you, your poor appreciation of yourself and all the little offerings you give slip into nothingness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Holy child of God, when will you learn that only holiness can content you and give you peace?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Remember that you learn not for yourself alone, no more than I did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is because I learned for you that you can learn of me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I would but teach you what is yours, so that together we can replace the shabby littleness that binds the host of God to guilt and weakness with the glad awareness of the glory that is in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>My birth in you is your awakening to grandeur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Welcome me not into a manger, but into the altar to holiness, where holiness abides in perfect peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>My Kingdom is not of this world because it is in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you are of your Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let us join in honoring you, who must remain forever beyond littleness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Decide with me, who has decided to abide with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I will as my Father wills, knowing His Will is constant and at peace forever with itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will be content with nothing but His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Accept no less, remembering that everything I learned is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What my Father loves I love as He does, and I can no more accept it as what it is not, than He can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And no more can you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When you have learned to accept what you are, you will make no more gifts to offer to yourself, for you will know you are complete, in need of nothing, and unable to accept anything for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But you will gladly give, having received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The host of God need not seek to find anything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span

be given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet think not you can substitute your plan for His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Rather, join with me in His, that we may release all those who would be bound, proclaiming together that the Son of God is host to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus will we let no one forget what you would remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus will you remember it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"192#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Call forth in everyone only the remembrance of God, and of the Heaven that is in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For where you would have your brother be, there will you think you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Hear not his appeal to hell and littleness, but only his call for Heaven and greatness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Forget not that his call is yours, and answer him with me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s power is forever on the side of His host, for it protects only the peace in which He dwells.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"192#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Lay not littleness before His holy altar, which rises above the stars and reaches even to Heaven, because of what is given it.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Be not content with littleness.
