data-sentence-id=\"215#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The practical application of the Holy Spirit’s purpose is extremely simple, but it is unequivocal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In fact, in order to be simple it <i>must</i> be unequivocal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The simple is merely what is easily understood, and for this it is apparent that it must be clear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The setting of the Holy Spirit’s goal is general.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now He will work with you to make it specific, for application <i>is</i> specific.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There are certain very specific guidelines He provides for any situation, but remember that you do not yet realize their universal application.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Therefore, it is essential at this point to use them in each situation separately, until you can more safely look beyond each situation, in an understanding far broader than you now possess.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"215#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In any situation in which you are uncertain, the first thing to consider, very simply, is “What do I want to come of this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What is it <i>for</i>?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The clarification of the goal belongs at the beginning, for it is this which will determine the outcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the ego’s procedure this is reversed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The situation becomes the determiner of the outcome, which can be anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The reason for this disorganized approach is evident.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ego does not know what it wants to come of the situation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is aware of what it does not want, but only that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It has no positive goal at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"215#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Without a clear-cut, positive goal, set at the outset, the situation just seems to happen, and makes no sense until it has already happened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Then you look back at it, and try to piece together what it must have meant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you will be wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Not only is your judgment in the past, but you have no idea what should happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No goal was set with which to bring the means in line.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And now the only judgment left to make is whether or not the ego likes it; is it acceptable, or does it call for vengeance?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The absence of a criterion for outcome, set in advance, makes understanding doubtful and evaluation impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"215#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The value of deciding in advance what you want to happen is simply that you will perceive the situation as a means to <i>make</i> it happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will therefore make every effort to overlook what interferes with the accomplishment of your objective, and concentrate on everything that helps you meet it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is quite noticeable that this approach has brought you closer to the Holy Spirit’s sorting out of truth and falsity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The true becomes what can be used to meet the goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The false becomes the useless from this point of view.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The situation now has meaning, but only because the goal has made it meaningful.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"215#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The goal of truth has further practical advantages.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If the situation is used for truth and sanity, its outcome must be peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this is quite apart from what the outcome <i>is</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If peace is the condition of truth and sanity, and cannot be without them, where peace is they must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Truth comes of itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you experience peace, it is because the truth has come to you and you will see the outcome truly, for deception cannot prevail against you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You will recognize the outcome <i>because</i> you are at peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Here again you see the opposite of the ego’s way of looking, for the ego believes the situation brings the experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The Holy Spirit knows that the situation is as the goal determines it, and is experienced according to the goal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"215#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The goal of truth requires faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Faith is implicit in the acceptance of the Holy Spirit’s purpose, and this faith is all-inclusive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Where the goal of truth is set, there faith must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit sees the situation as a whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The goal establishes the fact that everyone involved in it will play his part in its accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one will fail in anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This seems to ask for faith beyond you, and beyond what you can give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet this is so only from the viewpoint of the ego, for the ego believes in “solving” conflict through fragmentation, and does not perceive the situation as a whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Therefore, it seeks to split off segments of the situation and deal with them separately, for it has faith in separation and not in wholeness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"215#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Confronted with any aspect of the situation that seems to be difficult, the ego will attempt to take this aspect elsewhere, and resolve it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it will seem to be successful, except that this attempt conflicts with unity, and must obscure the goal of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And peace will not be experienced except in fantasy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Truth has not come because faith has been denied, being withheld from where it rightfully belonged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus do you lose the understanding of the situation the goal of truth would bring.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"215#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For fantasy solutions bring but the illusion of experience, and the illusion of peace is not the condition in which truth can enter.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The practical application of the Holy Spirit’s purpose is extremely simple, but it is unequivocal.
