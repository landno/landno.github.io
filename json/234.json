data-sentence-id=\"234#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the nature of love to look upon only the truth, for there it sees itself, with which it would unite in holy union and completion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As love must look past fear, so must fear see love not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For love contains the end of guilt, as surely as fear depends on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Love is attracted only to love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Overlooking guilt completely, it sees no fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Being wholly without attack, it could not be afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Fear is attracted to what love sees not, and each believes that what the other looks upon does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Fear looks on guilt with just the same devotion that love looks on itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And each has messengers which it sends forth, and which return to it with messages written in the language in which their going forth was asked.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"234#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Love’s messengers are gently sent, and return with messages of love and gentleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The messengers of fear are harshly ordered to seek out guilt, and cherish every scrap of evil and of sin that they can find, losing none of them on pain of death, and laying them respectfully before their lord and master.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Perception cannot obey two masters, each asking for messages of different things in different languages.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What fear would feed upon, love overlooks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What fear demands, love cannot even see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The fierce attraction that guilt holds for fear is wholly absent from love’s gentle perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What love would look upon is meaningless to fear, and quite invisible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"234#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Relationships in this world are the result of how the world is seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this depends on which emotion was called on to send its messengers to look upon it, and return with word of what they saw.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fear’s messengers are trained through terror, and they tremble when their master calls on them to serve him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For fear is merciless even to its friends.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its messengers steal guiltily away in hungry search of guilt, for they are kept cold and starving and made very vicious by their master, who allows them to feast only upon what they return to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No little shred of guilt escapes their hungry eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in their savage search for sin they pounce on any living thing they see, and carry it screaming to their master, to be devoured.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"234#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Send not these savage messengers into the world, to feast upon it and to prey upon reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For they will bring you word of bones and skin and flesh.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They have been taught to seek for the corruptible, and to return with gorges filled with things decayed and rotted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To them such things are beautiful, because they seem to allay their savage pangs of hunger.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For they are frantic with the pain of fear, and would avert the punishment of him who sends them forth by offering him what they hold dear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"234#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit has given you love’s messengers to send instead of those you trained through fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are as eager to return to you what they hold dear as are the others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you send them forth, they will see only the blameless and the beautiful, the gentle and the kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They will be as careful to let no little act of charity, no tiny expression of forgiveness, no little breath of love escape their notice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And they will return with all the happy things they found, to share them lovingly with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Be not afraid of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They offer you salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Theirs are the messages of safety, for they see the world as kind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"234#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you send forth only the messengers the Holy Spirit gives you, wanting no messages but theirs, you will see fear no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world will be transformed before your sight, cleansed of all guilt and softly brushed with beauty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world contains no fear that you laid not upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And none you cannot ask love’s messengers to remove from it, and see it still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit has given you His messengers to send to your brother and return to you with what love sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They have been given to replace the hungry dogs of fear you sent instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And they go forth to signify the end of fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"234#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Love, too, would set a feast before you, on a table covered with a spotless cloth, set in a quiet garden where no sound but singing and a softly joyous whispering is ever heard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is a feast that honors your holy relationship, and at which everyone is welcomed as an honored guest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And in a holy instant grace is said by everyone together, as they join in gentleness before the table of communion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And I will join you there, as long ago I promised and promise still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For in your new relationship am I made welcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And where I am made welcome, there I am.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"234#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I am made welcome in the state of grace, which means you have at last forgiven me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For I became the symbol of your sin, and so I had to die instead of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To the ego sin means death, and so atonement is achieved through murder.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation is looked upon as a way by which the Son of God was killed instead of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet would I offer you my body, you whom I love, <i>knowing</i> its littleness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Or would I teach that bodies cannot keep us apart?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Mine was of no greater value than yours; no better means for communication of salvation, but not its Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No one can die for anyone, and death does not atone for sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But you can live to show it is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The body does appear to be the symbol of sin while you believe that it can get you what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>While you believe that it can give you pleasure, you will also believe that it can bring you pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>To think you could be satisfied and happy with so little is to hurt yourself, and to limit the happiness that you would have calls upon pain to fill your meager store and make your life complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>This is completion as the ego sees it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>For guilt creeps in where happiness has been removed, and substitutes for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"234#17:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>Communion is another kind of completion, which goes beyond guilt, because it goes beyond the body.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The attraction of guilt produces fear
