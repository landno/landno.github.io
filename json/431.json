class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea for today explains why you can see all purpose in everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It explains why nothing is separate, by itself or in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And it explains why nothing you see means anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In fact, it explains every idea we have used thus far, and all subsequent ones as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Today‚Äôs idea is the whole basis for vision.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"431#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will probably find this idea very difficult to grasp at this point.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may find it silly, irreverent, senseless, funny and even objectionable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Certainly God is not in a table, for example, as you see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet we emphasized yesterday that a table shares the purpose of the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what shares the purpose of the universe shares the purpose of its Creator.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"431#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Try then, today, to begin to learn how to look on all things with love, appreciation and open-mindedness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not see them now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you know what is in them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing is as it appears to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its holy purpose stands beyond your little range.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When vision has shown you the holiness that lights up the world, you will understand today‚Äôs idea perfectly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you will not understand how you could ever have found it difficult.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"431#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our six two-minute practice periods for today should follow a now familiar pattern: Begin with repeating the idea to yourself, and then apply it to randomly chosen subjects about you, naming each one specifically.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try to avoid the tendency toward self-directed selection, which may be particularly tempting in connection with today‚Äôs idea because of its wholly alien nature.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember that any order you impose is equally alien to reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"431#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your list of subjects should therefore be as free of self-selection as possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For example, a suitable list might include:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God is in this coat hanger.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God is in this magazine.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God is in this finger.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God is in this lamp.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God is in that body.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God is in that door.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>God is in that waste basket.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>In addition to the assigned practice periods, repeat the idea for today at least once an hour, looking slowly about you as you say the words unhurriedly to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"431#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>At least once or twice, you should experience a sense of restfulness as you do this.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The idea
