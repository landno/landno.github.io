data-sentence-id=\"108#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To heal is the only kind of thinking in this world that resembles the Thought of God, and because of the elements they share, can transfer easily to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When a brother perceives himself as sick, he is perceiving himself as not whole, and therefore in need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you, too, see him this way, you are seeing him as if he were absent from the Kingdom or separated from it, thus making the Kingdom itself obscure to both of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Sickness and separation are not of God, but the Kingdom is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you obscure the Kingdom, you are perceiving what is not of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"108#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To heal, then, is to correct perception in your brother and yourself by sharing the Holy Spirit with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This places you both within the Kingdom, and restores its wholeness in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This reflects creation, because it unifies by increasing and integrates by extending.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you project or extend is real for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is an immutable law of the mind in this world as well as in the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>However, the content is different in this world, because the thoughts it governs are very different from the Thoughts in the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Laws must be adapted to circumstances if they are to maintain order.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The outstanding characteristic of the laws of mind as they operate in this world is that by obeying them, and I assure you that you must obey them, you can arrive at diametrically opposed results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is because the laws have been adapted to the circumstances of this world, in which diametrically opposed outcomes seem possible because you can respond to two conflicting voices.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"108#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Outside the Kingdom, the law that prevails inside is adapted to “What you project you believe.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is its teaching form, because outside the Kingdom learning is essential.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This form implies that you will learn what you are from what you have projected onto others, and therefore believe they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the Kingdom there is no teaching or learning, because there is no belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is only certainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God and His Sons, in the surety of being, know that what you extend you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That form of the law is not adapted at all, being the law of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God Himself created the law by creating <i>by</i> it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And His Sons, who create like Him, follow it gladly, knowing that the increase of the Kingdom depends on it, just as their own creation did.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"108#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Laws must be communicated if they are to be helpful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In effect, they must be translated for those who speak different languages.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nevertheless, a good translator, although he must alter the form of what he translates, never changes the meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In fact, his whole purpose is to change the form so that the original meaning is retained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit is the Translator of the laws of God to those who do not understand them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You could not do this yourself because a conflicted mind cannot be faithful to one meaning, and will therefore change the meaning to preserve the form.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"108#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s purpose in translating is exactly the opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He translates only to preserve the original meaning in all respects and in all languages.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, He opposes the idea that differences in form are meaningful, emphasizing always that <i>these differences do not matter.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The meaning of His message is always the same; only the meaning matters.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s law of creation does not involve the use of truth to convince His Sons of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The extension of truth, which <i>is</i> the law of the Kingdom, rests only on the knowledge of what truth is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is your inheritance and requires no learning at all, but when you disinherited yourself you became a learner of necessity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"108#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one questions the connection of learning and memory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Learning is impossible without memory since it must be consistent to be remembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is why the Holy Spirit’s teaching is a lesson in remembering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I said before that He teaches remembering and forgetting, but the forgetting is only to make the remembering consistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You forget in order to remember better.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will not understand His translations while you listen to two ways of interpreting them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Therefore you must forget or relinquish one to understand the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is the only way you can learn consistency, so that you can finally <i>be</i> consistent.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"108#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What can the perfect consistency of the Kingdom mean to those who are confused?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is apparent that confusion interferes with meaning, and therefore prevents the learner from appreciating it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no confusion in the Kingdom, because there is only one meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This meaning comes from God and <i>is</i> God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Because it is also you, you share it and extend it as your Creator did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This needs no translation because it is perfectly understood, but it does need extension because it <i>means</i> extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Communication is perfectly direct and perfectly united.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is totally free, because nothing discordant ever enters.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That is why it is the Kingdom of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It belongs to Him and is therefore like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"108#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>That is its reality, and nothing can assail it.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"To heal is the only kind of thinking in this world
