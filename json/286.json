data-sentence-id=\"286#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is it not evident that what the body’s eyes perceive fills you with fear?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you think you find a hope of satisfaction there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Perhaps you fancy to attain some peace and satisfaction in the world as you perceive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it must be evident the outcome does not change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Despite your hopes and fancies, always does despair result.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And there is no exception, nor will there ever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The only value that the past can hold is that you learn it gave you no rewards which you would want to keep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For only thus will you be willing to relinquish it, and have it gone forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is it not strange that you should cherish still some hope of satisfaction from the world you see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In no respect, at any time or place, has anything but fear and guilt been your reward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How long is needed for you to realize the chance of change in this respect is hardly worth delaying change that might result in better outcome?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For one thing is sure; the way you see, and long have seen, gives no support to base your future hopes, and no suggestions of success at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To place your hopes where no hope lies must make you hopeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet is this hopelessness your choice, while you would seek for hope where none is ever found.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is it not also true that you have found some hope apart from this; some glimmering,—inconstant, wavering, yet dimly seen,—that hopefulness is warranted on grounds that are not in this world?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And yet your hope that they may still be here prevents you still from giving up the hopeless and unrewarding task you set yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Can it make sense to hold the fixed belief that there is reason to uphold pursuit of what has always failed, on grounds that it will suddenly succeed and bring what it has never brought before?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Its past <i>has</i> failed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be glad that it is gone within your mind, to darken what is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Take not the form for content, for the form is but a means for content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And the frame is but a means to hold the picture up, so that it can be seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A frame that hides the picture has no purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It cannot be a frame if it is what you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Without the picture is the frame without its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Its purpose is to set the picture off, and not itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who hangs an empty frame upon a wall and stands before it, deep in reverence, as if a masterpiece were there to see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet if you see your brother as a body, it is but this you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The masterpiece that God has set within this frame is all there is to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The body holds it for a while, without obscuring it in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet what God has created needs no frame, for what He has created He supports and frames within Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His masterpiece He offers you to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And would you rather see the frame instead of this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And see the picture not at all?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is the frame God set around the part of Him that you would see as separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet its frame is joined to its Creator, one with Him and with His masterpiece.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is its purpose, and you do not make the frame into the picture when you choose to see it in its place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The frame that God has given it but serves His purpose, not yours apart from His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is your separate purpose that obscures the picture, and cherishes the frame instead of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet God has set His masterpiece within a frame that will endure forever, when yours has crumbled into dust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But think you not the picture is destroyed in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What God creates is safe from all corruption, unchanged and perfect in eternity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Accept God’s frame instead of yours, and you will see the masterpiece.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Look at its loveliness, and understand the Mind that thought it, not in flesh and bones, but in a frame as lovely as itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its holiness lights up the sinlessness the frame of darkness hides, and casts a veil of light across the picture’s face which but reflects the light that shines from it to its Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think not this face was ever darkened because you saw it in a frame of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God kept it safe that you might look on it, and see the holiness that He has given it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Within the darkness see the savior <i>from</i> the dark, and understand your brother as his Father’s Mind shows him to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He will step forth from darkness as you look on him, and you will see the dark no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The darkness touched him not, nor you who brought him forth for you to look upon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His sinlessness but pictures yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His gentleness becomes your strength, and both will gladly look within, and see the holiness that must be there because of what you looked upon in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is the frame in which your holiness is set, and what God gave him must be given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>However much he overlooks the masterpiece in him and sees only a frame of darkness, it is still your only function to behold in him what he sees not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And in this seeing is the vision shared that looks on Christ instead of seeing death.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How could the Lord of Heaven not be glad if you appreciate His masterpiece?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What could He do but offer thanks to you who love His Son as He does?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would He not make known to you His Love, if you but share His praise of what He loves?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God cherishes creation as the perfect Father that He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so His joy is made complete when any part of Him joins in His praise, to share His joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This brother is His perfect gift to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And He is glad and thankful when you thank His perfect Son for being what he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And all His thanks and gladness shine on you who would complete His joy, along with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And thus is yours completed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Not one ray of darkness can be seen by those who will to make their Father’s happiness complete, and theirs along with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The gratitude of God Himself is freely offered to everyone who shares His purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>It is not His Will to be alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#9:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>And neither is it yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgive your brother, and you cannot separate yourself from him nor from his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You need no forgiveness, for the wholly pure have never sinned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Give, then, what He has given you, that you may see His Son as one, and thank his Father as He thanks you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor believe that all His praise is given not to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For what you give is His, and giving it, you learn to understand His gift to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And give the Holy Spirit what He offers unto the Father and the Son alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing has power over you except His Will and yours, which but extends His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It was for this you were created, and your brother with you and at one with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"286#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You and your brother are the same, as God Himself is One and not divided in His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you must have one purpose, since He gave the same to both of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Will is brought together as you join in will, that you be made complete by offering completion to your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>See not in him the sinfulness he sees, but give him honor that you may esteem yourself and him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"286#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To you and your brother is given the power of salvation, that escape from darkness into light be yours to share; that you may see as one what never has been separate, nor apart from all God’s Love as given equally.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Is it not evident that what the body’s eyes perceive fills you with fear?
