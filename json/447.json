think, just as nothing that you think you see is related to vision in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no relationship between what is real and what you think is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing that you think are your real thoughts resemble your real thoughts in any respect.</span> <span

class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You think with the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore you share your thoughts with Him, as He shares His with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are the same thoughts, because they are thought by the same Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To share is to make alike, or to make one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor do the thoughts you think with the Mind of God leave your mind, because thoughts do not leave their source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Therefore, your thoughts are in the Mind of God, as you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are in your mind as well, where He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>As you are part of His Mind, so are your thoughts part of His Mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"447#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Where, then, are your real thoughts?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today we will attempt to reach them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will have to look for them in your mind, because that is where they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They must still be there, because they cannot have left their source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is thought by the Mind of God is eternal, being part of creation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"447#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our three five-minute practice periods for today will take the same general form that we used in applying yesterday‚Äôs idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will attempt to leave the unreal and seek for the real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will deny the world in favor of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We will not let the thoughts of the world hold us back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We will not let the beliefs of the world tell us that what God would have us do is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Instead, we will try to recognize that only what God would have us do is possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"447#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will also try to understand that only what God would have us do is what we want to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And we will also try to remember that we cannot fail in doing what He would have us do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is every reason to feel confident that we will succeed today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the Will of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"447#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin the exercises for today by repeating the idea to yourself, closing your eyes as you do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Then spend a fairly short period in thinking a few relevant thoughts of your own, keeping the idea in mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>After you have added some four or five thoughts of your own to the idea, repeat it again and tell yourself gently:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"447#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>My real thoughts are in my mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I would like to find them.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"447#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then try to go past all the unreal thoughts that cover the truth in your mind, and reach to the eternal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"447#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Under all the senseless thoughts and mad ideas with which you have cluttered up your mind are the thoughts that you thought with God in the beginning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are there in your mind now, completely unchanged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They will always be in your mind, exactly as they always were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everything you have thought since then will change, but the Foundation on which it rests is wholly changeless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"447#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is this Foundation toward which the exercises for today are directed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is your mind joined with the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here are your thoughts one with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For this kind of practice only one thing is necessary; approach it as you would an altar dedicated in Heaven to God the Father and to God the Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For such is the place you are trying to reach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will probably be unable as yet to realize how high you are trying to go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet even with the little understanding you have already gained, you should be able to remind yourself that this is no idle game, but an exercise in holiness and an attempt to reach the Kingdom of Heaven.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"447#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the shorter exercise periods for today, try to remember how important it is to you to understand the holiness of the mind that thinks with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Take a minute or two, as you repeat the idea throughout the day, to appreciate your mind‚Äôs holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Stand aside, however briefly, from all thoughts that are unworthy of Him Whose host you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"447#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thank Him for the Thoughts He is thinking with you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today‚Äôs idea holds the key
