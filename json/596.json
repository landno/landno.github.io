data-sentence-id=\"596#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why wait for Heaven?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Those who seek the light are merely covering their eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The light is in them now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Enlightenment is but a recognition, not a change at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Light is not of the world, yet you who bear the light in you are alien here as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The light came with you from your native home, and stayed with you because it is your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is the only thing you bring with you from Him Who is your Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It shines in you because it lights your home, and leads you back to where it came from and you are at home.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"596#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This light can not be lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Why wait to find it in the future, or believe it has been lost already, or was never there?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It can so easily be looked upon that arguments which prove it is not there become ridiculous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who can deny the presence of what he beholds in him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not difficult to look within, for there all vision starts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no sight, be it of dreams or from a truer Source, that is not but the shadow of the seen through inward vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There perception starts, and there it ends.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It has no source but this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"596#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The peace of God is shining in you now, and from your heart extends around the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It pauses to caress each living thing, and leaves a blessing with it that remains forever and forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What it gives must be eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It removes all thoughts of the ephemeral and valueless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It brings renewal to all tired hearts, and lights all vision as it passes by.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All of its gifts are given everyone, and everyone unites in giving thanks to you who give, and you who have received.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"596#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The shining in your mind reminds the world of what it has forgotten, and the world restores the memory to you as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From you salvation radiates with gifts beyond all measure, given and returned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To you, the giver of the gift, does God Himself give thanks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And in His blessing does the light in you shine brighter, adding to the gifts you have to offer to the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"596#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The peace of God can never be contained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who recognizes it within himself must give it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And the means for giving it are in his understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He forgives because he recognized the truth in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The peace of God is shining in you now, and in all living things.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In quietness is it acknowledged universally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For what your inward vision looks upon is your perception of the universe.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"596#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sit quietly and close your eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The light within you is sufficient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It alone has power to give the gift of sight to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Exclude the outer world, and let your thoughts fly to the peace within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They know the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For honest thoughts, untainted by the dream of worldly things outside yourself, become the holy messengers of God Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"596#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These thoughts you think with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They recognize their home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And they point surely to their Source, Where God the Father and the Son are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God’s peace is shining on them, but they must remain with you as well, for they were born within your mind, as yours was born in God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They lead you back to peace, from where they came but to remind you how you must return.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"596#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>They heed your Father’s Voice when you refuse to listen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And they urge you gently to accept His Word for what you are, instead of fantasies and shadows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They remind you that you are the co-creator of all things that live.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For as the peace of God is shining in you, it must shine on them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"596#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We practice coming nearer to the light in us today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We take our wandering thoughts, and gently bring them back to where they fall in line with all the thoughts we share with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will not let them stray.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We let the light within our minds direct them to come home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We have betrayed them, ordering that they depart from us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But now we call them back, and wash them clean of strange desires and disordered wishes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>We restore to them the holiness of their inheritance.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"596#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus are our minds restored with them, and we acknowledge that the peace of God still shines in us, and from us to all living things that share our life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will forgive them all, absolving all the world from what we thought it did to us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it is we who make the world as we would have it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now we choose that it be innocent, devoid of sin and open to salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And we lay our saving blessing on it, as we say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"596#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The peace of God is shining in me now.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"596#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let all things shine upon me in that peace, and let me bless them with the light in me.</span></p></div>
