data-sentence-id=\"541#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can heal unless he understands what purpose sickness seems to serve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For then he understands as well its purpose has no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Being causeless and without a meaningful intent of any kind, it cannot be at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When this is seen, healing is automatic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It dispels this meaningless illusion by the same approach that carries all of them to truth, and merely leaves them there to disappear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness is not an accident.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Like all defenses, it is an insane device for self-deception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And like all the rest, its purpose is to hide reality, attack it, change it, render it inept, distort it, twist it, or reduce it to a little pile of unassembled parts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The aim of all defenses is to keep the truth from being whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The parts are seen as if each one were whole within itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Defenses are not unintentional, nor are they made without awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are secret, magic wands you wave when truth appears to threaten what you would believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They seem to be unconscious but because of the rapidity with which you choose to use them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In that second, even less, in which the choice is made, you recognize exactly what you would attempt to do, and then proceed to think that it is done.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who but yourself evaluates a threat, decides escape is necessary, and sets up a series of defenses to reduce the threat that has been judged as real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All this cannot be done unconsciously.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But afterwards, your plan requires that you must forget you made it, so it seems to be external to your own intent; a happening beyond your state of mind, an outcome with a real effect on you, instead of one effected by yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is this quick forgetting of the part you play in making your “reality” that makes defenses seem to be beyond your own control.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But what you have forgot can be remembered, given willingness to reconsider the decision which is doubly shielded by oblivion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your not remembering is but the sign that this decision still remains in force, as far as your desires are concerned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Mistake not this for fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Defenses must make facts unrecognizable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They aim at doing this, and it is this they do.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every defense takes fragments of the whole, assembles them without regard to all their true relationships, and thus constructs illusions of a whole that is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is this process that imposes threat, and not whatever outcome may result.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When parts are wrested from the whole and seen as separate and wholes within themselves, they become symbols standing for attack upon the whole; successful in effect, and never to be seen as whole again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet you have forgotten that they stand but for your own decision of what should be real, to take the place of what is real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness is a decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not a thing that happens to you, quite unsought, which makes you weak and brings you suffering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a choice you make, a plan you lay, when for an instant truth arises in your own deluded mind, and all your world appears to totter and prepare to fall.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now are you sick, that truth may go away and threaten your establishments no more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How do you think that sickness can succeed in shielding you from truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Because it proves the body is not separate from you, and so you must be separate from the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You suffer pain because the body does, and in this pain are you made one with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus is your “true” identity preserved, and the strange, haunting thought that you might be something beyond this little pile of dust silenced and stilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For see, this dust can make you suffer, twist your limbs and stop your heart, commanding you to die and cease to be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus is the body stronger than the truth, which asks you live, but cannot overcome your choice to die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so the body is more powerful than everlasting life, Heaven more frail than hell, and God’s design for the salvation of His Son opposed by a decision stronger than His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Son is dust, the Father incomplete, and chaos sits in triumph on His throne.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is your planning for your own defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you believe that Heaven quails before such mad attacks as these, with God made blind by your illusions, truth turned into lies, and all the universe made slave to laws which your defenses would impose on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet who believes illusions but the one who made them up?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who else can see them and react to them as if they were the truth?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God knows not of your plans to change His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The universe remains unheeding of the laws by which you thought to govern it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And Heaven has not bowed to hell, nor life to death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can but choose to think you die, or suffer sickness or distort the truth in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is created is apart from all of this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Defenses are plans to defeat what cannot be attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What is unalterable cannot change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And what is wholly sinless cannot sin.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is the simple truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not make appeal to might nor triumph.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It does not command obedience, nor seek to prove how pitiful and futile your attempts to plan defenses that would alter it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Truth merely wants to give you happiness, for such its purpose is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perhaps it sighs a little when you throw away its gifts, and yet it knows, with perfect certainty, that what God wills for you must be received.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is this fact that demonstrates that time is an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For time lets you think what God has given you is not the truth right now, as it must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Thoughts of God are quite apart from time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For time is but another meaningless defense you made against the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet what He wills is here, and you remain as He created you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth has a power far beyond defense, for no illusions can remain where truth has been allowed to enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it comes to any mind that would lay down its arms, and cease to play with folly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is found at any time; today, if you will choose to practice giving welcome to the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is our aim today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And we will give a quarter of an hour twice to ask the truth to come to us and set us free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And truth will come, for it has never been apart from us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It merely waits for just this invitation which we give today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We introduce it with a healing prayer, to help us rise above defensiveness, and let truth be as it has always been:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Sickness is a defense against the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I will accept the truth of what I am, and let my mind be wholly healed today.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing will flash across your open mind, as peace and truth arise to take the place of war and vain imaginings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There will be no dark corners sickness can conceal, and keep defended from the light of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There will be no dim figures from your dreams, nor their obscure and meaningless pursuits with double purposes insanely sought, remaining in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It will be healed of all the sickly wishes that it tried to authorize the body to obey.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now is the body healed, because the source of sickness has been opened to relief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you will recognize you practiced well by this: The body should not feel at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you have been successful, there will be no sense of feeling ill or feeling well, of pain or pleasure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No response at all is in the mind to what the body does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its usefulness remains and nothing more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#18\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">18.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#18:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps you do not realize that this removes the limits you had placed upon the body by the purposes you gave to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#18:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As these are laid aside, the strength the body has will always be enough to serve all truly useful purposes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#18:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body’s health is fully guaranteed, because it is not limited by time, by weather or fatigue, by food and drink, or any laws you made it serve before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#18:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You need do nothing now to make it well, for sickness has become impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#19\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">19.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#19:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet this protection needs to be preserved by careful watching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#19:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you let your mind harbor attack thoughts, yield to judgment or make plans against uncertainties to come, you have again misplaced yourself, and made a bodily identity which will attack the body, for the mind is sick.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#20\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">20.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Give instant remedy, should this occur, by not allowing your defensiveness to hurt you longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not be confused about what must be healed, but tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have forgotten what I really am, for I mistook my body for myself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Sickness is a defense against the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But I am not a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And my mind cannot attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>So I can not be sick.</span></p></div>
