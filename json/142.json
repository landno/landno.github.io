data-sentence-id=\"142#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All magic is an attempt at reconciling the irreconcilable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All religion is the recognition that the irreconcilable cannot be reconciled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Sickness and perfection are irreconcilable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If God created you perfect, you <i>are</i> perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you believe you can be sick, you have placed other gods before Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God is not at war with the god of sickness you made, but you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He is the symbol of deciding against God, and you are afraid of him because he cannot be reconciled with God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you attack him, you will make him real to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But if you refuse to worship him in whatever form he may appear to you, and wherever you think you see him, he will disappear into the nothingness out of which he was made.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"142#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Reality can dawn only on an unclouded mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is always there to be accepted, but its acceptance depends on your willingness to have it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To know reality must involve the willingness to judge unreality for what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To overlook nothingness is merely to judge it correctly, and because of your ability to evaluate it truly, to let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Knowledge cannot dawn on a mind full of illusions, because truth and illusions are irreconcilable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Truth is whole, and cannot be known by part of a mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"142#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Sonship cannot be perceived as partly sick, because to perceive it that way is not to perceive it at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If the Sonship is one, it is one in all respects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Oneness cannot be divided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you perceive other gods your mind is split, and you will not be able to limit the split, because it is the sign that you have removed part of your mind from God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This means it is out of control.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To be out of control is to be out of reason, and then the mind does become unreasonable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>By defining the mind wrongly, you perceive it as functioning wrongly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"142#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s laws will keep your mind at peace because peace is His Will, and His laws are established to uphold it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His are the laws of freedom, but yours are the laws of bondage.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Since freedom and bondage are irreconcilable, their laws cannot be understood together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The laws of God work only for your good, and there are no other laws beside His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everything else is merely lawless and therefore chaotic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet God Himself has protected everything He created by His laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Everything that is not under them does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>“Laws of chaos” is a meaningless term.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Creation is perfectly lawful, and the chaotic is without meaning because it is without God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You have “given” your peace to the gods you made, but they are not there to take it from you, and you cannot give it to them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"142#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are not free to give up freedom, but only to deny it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot do what God did not intend, because what He did not intend does not happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your gods do not bring chaos; you are endowing them with chaos, and accepting it of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All this has never been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothing but the laws of God has ever been, and nothing but His Will will ever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You were created through His laws and by His Will, and the manner of your creation established you a creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What you have made is so unworthy of you that you could hardly want it, if you were willing to see it as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You will see nothing at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And your vision will automatically look beyond it, to what is in you and all around you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Reality cannot break through the obstructions you interpose, but it will envelop you completely when you let them go.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"142#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have experienced the protection of God, the making of idols becomes inconceivable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There are no strange images in the Mind of God, and what is not in His Mind cannot be in yours, because you are of one mind and that mind belongs to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is yours <i>because</i> it belongs to Him, for to Him ownership is sharing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if it is so for Him, it is so for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His definitions <i>are</i> His laws, for by them He established the universe as what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No false gods you attempt to interpose between yourself and your reality affect truth at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Peace is yours because God created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And He created nothing else.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"142#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle is the act of a Son of God who has laid aside all false gods, and calls on his brothers to do likewise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is an act of faith, because it is the recognition that his brother can do it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a call to the Holy Spirit in his mind, a call that is strengthened by joining.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Because the miracle worker has heard God’s Voice, he strengthens It in a sick brother by weakening his belief in sickness, which he does not share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The power of one mind can shine into another, because all the lamps of God were lit by the same spark.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is everywhere and it is eternal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"142#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In many only the spark remains, for the Great Rays are obscured.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet God has kept the spark alive so that the Rays can never be completely forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you but see the little spark you will learn of the greater light, for the Rays are there unseen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perceiving the spark will heal, but knowing the light will create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet in the returning the little light must be acknowledged first, for the separation was a descent from magnitude to littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But the spark is still as pure as the Great Light, because it is the remaining call of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"142#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Put all your faith in it, and God Himself will answer you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"All magic is an attempt at reconciling
