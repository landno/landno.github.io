data-sentence-id=\"132#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Atonement is for all, because it is the way to undo the belief that anything is for you alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To forgive is to overlook.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Look, then, beyond error and do not let your perception rest upon it, for you will believe what your perception holds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Accept as true only what your brother is, if you would know yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perceive what he is not and you cannot know what you are, because you see him falsely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Remember always that your Identity is shared, and that Its sharing is Its reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have a part to play in the Atonement, but the plan of the Atonement is beyond you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not understand how to overlook errors, or you would not make them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It would merely be further error to believe either that you do not make them, or that you can correct them without a Guide to correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if you do not follow this Guide, your errors will not be corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The plan is not yours because of your limited ideas about what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This sense of limitation is where all errors arise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The way to undo them, therefore, is not <i>of</i> you but <i>for</i> you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Atonement is a lesson in sharing, which is given you because <i>you have forgotten how to do it</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit merely reminds you of the natural use of your abilities.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By reinterpreting the ability to attack into the ability to share, He translates what you have made into what God created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you would accomplish this through Him you cannot look on your abilities through the eyes of the ego, or you will judge them as <i>it</i> does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All their harmfulness lies in the ego’s judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All their helpfulness lies in the judgment of the Holy Spirit.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego, too, has a plan of forgiveness because you are asking for one, though not of the right teacher.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego’s plan, of course, makes no sense and will not work.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By following its plan you will merely place yourself in an impossible situation, to which the ego always leads you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego’s plan is to have you see error clearly first, and then overlook it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet how can you overlook what you have made real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>By seeing it clearly, you have made it real and <i>cannot</i> overlook it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is where the ego is forced to appeal to “mysteries,” insisting that you must accept the meaningless to save yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Many have tried to do this in my name, forgetting that my words make perfect sense because they come from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>They are as sensible now as they ever were, because they speak of ideas that are eternal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness that is learned of me does not use fear to undo fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor does it make real the unreal and then destroy it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiveness through the Holy Spirit lies simply in looking beyond error from the beginning, and thus keeping it unreal for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not let any belief in its realness enter your mind, or you will also believe that you must undo what you have made in order to be forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What has no effect does not exist, and to the Holy Spirit the effects of error are nonexistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>By steadily and consistently cancelling out all its effects, everywhere and in all respects, He teaches that the ego does not exist and proves it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Follow the Holy Spirit’s teaching in forgiveness, then, because forgiveness is His function and He knows how to fulfill it perfectly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is what I meant when I said that miracles are natural, and when they do not occur something has gone wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Miracles are merely the sign of your willingness to follow the Holy Spirit’s plan of salvation, recognizing that you do not understand what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His work is not your function, and unless you accept this you cannot learn what your function is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The confusion of functions is so typical of the ego that you should be quite familiar with it by now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego believes that all functions belong to it, even though it has no idea what they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is more than mere confusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a particularly dangerous combination of grandiosity and confusion that makes the ego likely to attack anyone and anything for no reason at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is exactly what the ego does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is unpredictable in its responses, because it has no idea of what it perceives.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you have no idea what is happening, how appropriately can you expect to react?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You might ask yourself, regardless of how you may account for the reaction, whether its unpredictability places the ego in a sound position as your guide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let me repeat that the ego’s qualifications as a guide are singularly unfortunate, and that it is a remarkably poor choice as a teacher of salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Anyone who elects a totally insane guide must be totally insane himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor is it true that you do not realize the guide is insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You realize it because I realize it, and you have judged it by the same standard I have.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego literally lives on borrowed time, and its days are numbered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not fear the Last Judgment, but welcome it and do not wait, for the ego’s time is “borrowed” from your eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the Second Coming that was made for you as the First was created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Second Coming is merely the return of sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can this possibly be fearful?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What can be fearful but fantasy, and who turns to fantasy unless he despairs of finding satisfaction in reality?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it is certain that you will never find satisfaction in fantasy, so that your only hope is to change your mind about reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only if the decision that reality is fearful is wrong can God be right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And I assure you that God <i>is</i> right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be glad, then, that you have been wrong, but this was only because you did not know who you were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Had you known, you could no more have been wrong than God can.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The impossible can happen only in fantasy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you search for reality in fantasies you will not find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The symbols of fantasy are of the ego, and of these you will find many.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But do not look for meaning in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They have no more meaning than the fantasies into which they are woven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Fairy tales can be pleasant or fearful, but no one calls them true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Children may believe them, and so, for a while, the tales are true for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet when reality dawns, the fantasies are gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Reality has not gone in the meanwhile.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The Second Coming is the awareness of reality, not its return.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"132#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Behold, my child, reality is here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It belongs to you and me and God, and is perfectly satisfying to all of Us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"132#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only this awareness heals, because it is the awareness of truth.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Atonement is for all, because it is the way to undo the belief that
