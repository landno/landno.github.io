<span data-sentence-id=\"906#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To be a teacher of God, it is not necessary to be religious or even to believe in God to any recognizable extent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is necessary, however, to teach forgiveness rather than condemnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Even in this, complete consistency is not required, for one who had achieved that point could teach salvation completely, within an instant and without a word.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet he who has learned all things does not need a teacher, and the healed have no need for a therapist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Relationships are still the temple of the Holy Spirit, and they will be made perfect in time and restored to eternity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"906#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Formal religion has no place in psychotherapy, but it also has no real place in religion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this world, there is an astonishing tendency to join contradictory words into one term without perceiving the contradiction at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The attempt to formalize religion is so obviously an ego attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable that it hardly requires elaboration here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Religion is experience; psychotherapy is experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>At the highest levels they become one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Neither is truth itself, but both can lead to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What can be necessary to find truth, which remains perfectly obvious, but to remove the seeming obstacles to true awareness?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"906#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one who learns to forgive can fail to remember God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Forgiveness, then, is all that need be taught, because it is all that need be learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All blocks to the remembrance of God are forms of unforgiveness, and nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is never apparent to the patient, and only rarely so to the therapist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The world has marshalled all its forces against this one awareness, for in it lies the ending of the world and all it stands for.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"906#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet it is not the awareness of God that constitutes a reasonable goal for psychotherapy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This will come when psychotherapy is complete, for where there is forgiveness truth must come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It would be unfair indeed if belief in God were necessary to psychotherapeutic success.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor is belief in God a really meaningful concept, for God can be but known.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Belief implies that unbelief is possible, but knowledge of God has no true opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Not to know God is to have no knowledge, and it is to this that all unforgiveness leads.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And without knowledge one can have only belief.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"906#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Different teaching aids appeal to different people.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Some forms of religion have nothing to do with God, and some forms of psychotherapy have nothing to do with healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet if pupil and teacher join in sharing one goal, God will enter into their relationship because He has been invited to come in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the same way, a union of purpose between patient and therapist restores the place of God to ascendance, first through Christ’s vision and then through the memory of God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The process of psychotherapy is the return to sanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Teacher and pupil, therapist and patient, are all insane or they would not be here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Together they can find a pathway out, for no one will find sanity alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"906#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If healing is an invitation to God to enter into His Kingdom, what difference does it make how the invitation is written?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Does the paper matter, or the ink, or the pen?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Or is it he who writes that gives the invitation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God comes to those who would restore His world, for they have found the way to call to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If any two are joined, He must be there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It does not matter what their purpose is, but they must share it wholly to succeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is impossible to share a goal not blessed by Christ, for what is unseen through His eyes is too fragmented to be meaningful.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"906#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As true religion heals, so must true psychotherapy be religious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But both have many forms, because no good teacher uses one approach to every pupil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>On the contrary, he listens patiently to each one, and lets him formulate his own curriculum; not the curriculum’s goal, but how he can best reach the aim it sets for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perhaps the teacher does not think of God as part of teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perhaps the psychotherapist does not understand that healing comes from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They can succeed where many who believe they have found God will fail.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"906#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What must the teacher do to ensure learning?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What must the therapist do to bring healing about?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only one thing; the same requirement salvation asks of everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each one must share one goal with someone else, and in so doing, lose all sense of separate interests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only by doing this is it possible to transcend the narrow boundaries the ego would impose upon the self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only by doing this can teacher and pupil, therapist and patient, you and I, accept Atonement and learn to give it as it was received.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"906#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Communion is impossible alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one who stands apart can receive Christ’s vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is held out to him, but he cannot hold out his hand to receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let him be still and recognize his brother’s need is his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And let him then meet his brother’s need as his and see that they are met as one, for such they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What is religion but an aid in helping him to see that this is so?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And what is psychotherapy except a help in just this same direction?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"906#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is the goal that makes these processes the same, for they are one in purpose and must thus be one in means.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"To be a teacher of God, it is not necessary to be religious or even to believe in
