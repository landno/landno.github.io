data-sentence-id=\"161#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Miracles demonstrate that learning has occurred under the right guidance, for learning is invisible and what has been learned can be recognized only by its results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its generalization is demonstrated as you use it in more and more situations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will recognize that you have learned there is no order of difficulty in miracles when you apply them to all situations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no situation to which miracles do not apply, and by applying them to all situations you will gain the real world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For in this holy perception you will be made whole, and the Atonement will radiate from your acceptance of it for yourself to everyone the Holy Spirit sends you for your blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In every child of God His blessing lies, and in your blessing of the children of God is His blessing to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone in the world must play his part in its redemption, in order to recognize that the world has been redeemed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot see the invisible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet if you see its effects you know it must be there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By perceiving what it does, you recognize its being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And by what it does, you learn what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot see your strengths, but you gain confidence in their existence as they enable you to act.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And the results of your actions you <i>can</i> see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is invisible, but you can see the results of His Presence, and through them you will learn that He is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What He enables you to do is clearly not of this world, for miracles violate every law of reality as this world judges it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every law of time and space, of magnitude and mass is transcended, for what the Holy Spirit enables you to do is clearly beyond all of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perceiving His results, you will understand where He must be, and finally know what He is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot see the Holy Spirit, but you can see His manifestations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And unless you do, you will not realize He is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Miracles are His witnesses, and speak for His Presence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you cannot see becomes real to you only through the witnesses that speak for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For you can be aware of what you cannot see, and it can become compellingly real to you as its presence becomes manifest through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do the Holy Spirit’s work, for you share in His function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As your function in Heaven is creation, so your function on earth is healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God shares His function with you in Heaven, and the Holy Spirit shares His with you on earth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>As long as you believe you have other functions, so long will you need correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For this belief is the destruction of peace, a goal in direct opposition to the Holy Spirit’s purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You see what you expect, and you expect what you invite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your perception is the result of your invitation, coming to you as you sent for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whose manifestations would you see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Of whose presence would you be convinced?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For you will believe in what you manifest, and as you look out so will you see in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Two ways of looking at the world are in your mind, and your perception will reflect the guidance you have chosen.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I am the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, and when you see me it will be because you have invited Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For He will send you His witnesses if you will but look upon them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember always that you see what you seek, for what you seek you will find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego finds what it seeks, and only that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It does not find love, for that is not what it is seeking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet seeking and finding are the same, and if you seek for two goals you will find them, but you will recognize neither.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You will think they are the same because you want both of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The mind always strives for integration, and if it is split and wants to keep the split, it will still believe it has one goal by making it seem to be one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I said before that what you project or extend is up to you, but you must do one or the other, for that is a law of mind, and you must look in before you look out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As you look in, you choose the guide for seeing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And then you look out and behold his witnesses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is why you find what you seek.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you want in yourself you will make manifest, and you will accept it from the world because you put it there by wanting it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you think you are projecting what you do not want, it is still because you <i>do</i> want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This leads directly to dissociation, for it represents the acceptance of two goals, each perceived in a different place; separated from each other because you made them different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The mind then sees a divided world outside itself, but not within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This gives it an illusion of integrity, and enables it to believe that it is pursuing one goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet as long as you perceive the world as split, you are not healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>For to be healed is to pursue one goal, because you have accepted only one and want but one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you want only love you will see nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The contradictory nature of the witnesses you perceive is merely the reflection of your conflicting invitations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have looked upon your mind and accepted opposition there, having sought it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But do not then believe that the witnesses for opposition are true, for they attest only to your decision about reality, returning to you the messages you gave them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Love, too, is recognized by its messengers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you make love manifest, its messengers will come to you because you invited them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The power of decision is your one remaining freedom as a prisoner of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can decide to see it right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What you made of it is not its reality, for its reality is only what you give it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot really give anything but love to anyone or anything, nor can you really receive anything but love from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you think you have received anything else, it is because you have looked within and thought you saw the power to give something else within yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It was only this decision that determined what you found, for it was the decision for what you sought.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are afraid of me because you looked within and are afraid of what you saw.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you could not have seen reality, for the reality of your mind is the loveliest of God’s creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Coming only from God, its power and grandeur could only bring you peace <i>if you really looked upon it.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you are afraid, it is because you saw something that is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet in that same place you could have looked upon me and all your brothers, in the perfect safety of the Mind which created us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For we are there in the peace of the Father, Who wills to extend His peace through you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have accepted your mission to extend peace you will find peace, for by making it manifest you will see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its holy witnesses will surround you because you called upon them, and they will come to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have heard your call and I have answered it, but you will not look upon me nor hear the answer that you sought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is because you do not yet want <i>only</i> that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet as I become more real to you, you will learn that you do want only that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will see me as you look within, and we will look upon the real world together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Through the eyes of Christ, only the real world exists and only the real world can be seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>As you decide so will you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And all that you see but witnesses to your decision.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you look within and see me, it will be because you have decided to manifest truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And as you manifest it you will see it both without and within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will see it without <i>because</i> you saw it first within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everything you behold without is a judgment of what you beheld within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If it is your judgment it will be wrong, for judgment is not your function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it is the judgment of the Holy Spirit it will be right, for judgment <i>is</i> His function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You share His function only by judging as He does, reserving no judgment at all for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You will judge against yourself, but He will judge <i>for</i> you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember, then, that whenever you look without and react unfavorably to what you see, you have judged yourself unworthy and have condemned yourself to death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The death penalty is the ego’s ultimate goal, for it fully believes that you are a criminal, as deserving of death as God knows you are deserving of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The death penalty never leaves the ego’s mind, for that is what it always reserves for you in the end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Wanting to kill you as the final expression of its feeling for you, it lets you live but to await death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It will torment you while you live, but its hatred is not satisfied until you die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For your destruction is the one end toward which it works, and the only end with which it will be satisfied.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is not a traitor to God, to Whom treachery is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But it is a traitor to you who believe that you have been treacherous to your Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is why the undoing of guilt is an essential part of the Holy Spirit’s teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For as long as you feel guilty you are listening to the voice of the ego, which tells you that you have been treacherous to God and therefore deserve death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will think that death comes from God and not from the ego because, by confusing yourself with the ego, you believe that you want death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And from what you want God does not save you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"161#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you are tempted to yield to the desire for death, <i>remember that I did not die.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will realize that this is true when you look within and <i>see</i> me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would I have overcome death for myself alone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And would eternal life have been given me of the Father unless He had also given it to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When you learn to make me manifest, you will never see death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"161#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For you will have looked upon the deathless in yourself, and you will see only the eternal as you look out upon a world that cannot die.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Miracles demonstrate that learning has occurred under the right
