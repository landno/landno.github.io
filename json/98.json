data-sentence-id=\"098#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For learning purposes, let us consider the crucifixion again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I did not dwell on it before because of the fearful connotations you may associate with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The only emphasis laid upon it so far has been that it was not a form of punishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing, however, can be explained in negative terms only.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is a positive interpretation of the crucifixion that is wholly devoid of fear, and therefore wholly benign in what it teaches, if it is properly understood.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The crucifixion is nothing more than an extreme example.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its value, like the value of any teaching device, lies solely in the kind of learning it facilitates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It can be, and has been, misunderstood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is only because the fearful are apt to perceive fearfully.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I have already told you that you can always call on me to share my decision, and thus make it stronger.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I have also told you that the crucifixion was the last useless journey the Sonship need take, and that it represents release from fear to anyone who understands it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>While I emphasized only the resurrection before, the purpose of the crucifixion and how it actually led to the resurrection was not clarified then.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nevertheless, it has a definite contribution to make to your own life, and if you will consider it without fear, it will help you understand your own role as a teacher.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have probably reacted for years as if you were being crucified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is a marked tendency of the separated, who always refuse to consider what they have done to themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Projection means anger, anger fosters assault, and assault promotes fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The real meaning of the crucifixion lies in the <i>apparent</i> intensity of the assault of some of the Sons of God upon another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This, of course, is impossible, and must be fully understood <i>as</i> impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Otherwise, I cannot serve as a model for learning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Assault can ultimately be made only on the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is little doubt that one body can assault another, and can even destroy it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet if destruction itself is impossible, anything that is destructible cannot be real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its destruction, therefore, does not justify anger.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To the extent to which you believe that it does, you are accepting false premises and teaching them to others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The message the crucifixion was intended to teach was that it is not necessary to perceive any form of assault in persecution, because you cannot <i>be</i> persecuted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you respond with anger, you must be equating yourself with the destructible, and are therefore regarding yourself insanely.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have made it perfectly clear that I am like you and you are like me, but our fundamental equality can be demonstrated only through joint decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are free to perceive yourself as persecuted if you choose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you do choose to react that way, however, you might remember that I was persecuted as the world judges, and did not share this evaluation for myself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And because I did not share it, I did not strengthen it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I therefore offered a different interpretation of attack, and one which I want to share with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you will believe it, you will help me teach it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As I have said before, “As you teach so shall you learn.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you react as if you are persecuted, you are teaching persecution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is not a lesson a Son of God should want to teach if he is to realize his own salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Rather, teach your own perfect immunity, which is the truth in you, and realize that it cannot <i>be</i> assailed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not try to protect it yourself, or you are believing that it is assailable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are not asked to be crucified, which was part of my own teaching contribution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are merely asked to follow my example in the face of much less extreme temptations to misperceive, and not to accept them as false justifications for anger.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There can be no justification for the unjustifiable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Do not believe there is, and do not teach that there is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Remember always that what you believe you will teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Believe with me, and we will become equal as teachers.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your resurrection is your reawakening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I am the model for rebirth, but rebirth itself is merely the dawning on your mind of what is already in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God placed it there Himself, and so it is true forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I believed in it, and therefore accepted it as true for me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Help me to teach it to our brothers in the name of the Kingdom of God, but first believe that it is true for you, or you will teach amiss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>My brothers slept during the so-called “agony in the garden,” but I could not be angry with them because I knew I could not <i>be</i> abandoned.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I am sorry when my brothers do not share my decision to hear only one Voice, because it weakens them as teachers and as learners.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet I know they cannot really betray themselves or me, and that it is still on them that I must build my church.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no choice in this, because only you can be the foundation of God’s church.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A church is where an altar is, and the presence of the altar is what makes the church holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A church that does not inspire love has a hidden altar that is not serving the purpose for which God intended it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I must found His church on you, because those who accept me as a model are literally my disciples.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Disciples are followers, and if the model they follow has chosen to save them pain in all respects, they are unwise not to follow him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I elected, for your sake and mine, to demonstrate that the most outrageous assault, as judged by the ego, does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As the world judges these things, but not as God knows them, I was betrayed, abandoned, beaten, torn, and finally killed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It was clear that this was only because of the projection of others onto me, since I had not harmed anyone and had healed many.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We are still equal as learners, although we do not need to have equal experiences.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit is glad when you can learn from mine, and be reawakened by them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is their only purpose, and that is the only way in which I can be perceived as the way, the truth and the life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you hear only one Voice you are never called on to sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>On the contrary, by being able to hear the Holy Spirit in others you can learn from their experiences, and can gain from them without experiencing them directly yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is because the Holy Spirit is one, and anyone who listens is inevitably led to demonstrate His way for all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are not persecuted, nor was I.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are not asked to repeat my experiences because the Holy Spirit, Whom we share, makes this unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To use my experiences constructively, however, you must still follow my example in how to perceive them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>My brothers and yours are constantly engaged in justifying the unjustifiable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>My one lesson, which I must teach as I learned it, is that no perception that is out of accord with the judgment of the Holy Spirit can be justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I undertook to show this was true in an extreme case, merely because it would serve as a good teaching aid to those whose temptation to give in to anger and assault would not be so extreme.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I will with God that none of His Sons should suffer.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The crucifixion cannot be shared because it is the symbol of projection, but the resurrection is the symbol of sharing because the reawakening of every Son of God is necessary to enable the Sonship to know its Wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only this is knowledge.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The message of the crucifixion is perfectly clear:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"098#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Teach only love, for that is what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you interpret the crucifixion in any other way, you are using it as a weapon for assault rather than as the call for peace for which it was intended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Apostles often misunderstood it, and for the same reason that anyone misunderstands it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Their own imperfect love made them vulnerable to projection, and out of their own fear they spoke of the “wrath of God” as His retaliatory weapon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor could they speak of the crucifixion entirely without anger, because their sense of guilt had made them angry.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These are some of the examples of upside-down thinking in the New Testament, although its gospel is really only the message of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If the Apostles had not felt guilty, they never could have quoted me as saying, “I come not to bring peace but a sword.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is clearly the opposite of everything I taught.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor could they have described my reactions to Judas as they did, if they had really understood me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I could not have said, “Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?” unless I believed in betrayal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The whole message of the crucifixion was simply that I did not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The “punishment” I was said to have called forth upon Judas was a similar mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#15:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Judas was my brother and a Son of God, as much a part of the Sonship as myself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#15:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Was it likely that I would condemn him when I was ready to demonstrate that condemnation is impossible?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As you read the teachings of the Apostles, remember that I told them myself that there was much they would understand later, because they were not wholly ready to follow me at the time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I do not want you to allow any fear to enter into the thought system toward which I am guiding you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I do not call for martyrs but for teachers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one is punished for sins, and the Sons of God are not sinners.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Any concept of punishment involves the projection of blame, and reinforces the idea that blame is justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The result is a lesson in blame, for all behavior teaches the beliefs that motivate it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#16:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The crucifixion was the result of clearly opposed thought systems; the perfect symbol of the “conflict” between the ego and the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#16:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This conflict seems just as real now, and its lessons must be learned now as well as then.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I do not need gratitude, but you need to develop your weakened ability to be grateful, or you cannot appreciate God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He does not need your appreciation, but <i>you</i> do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot love what you do not appreciate, for fear makes appreciation impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you are afraid of what you are you do not appreciate it, and will therefore reject it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As a result, you will teach rejection.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#18\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">18.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#18:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The power of the Sons of God is present all the time, because they were created as creators.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#18:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Their influence on each other is without limit, and must be used for their joint salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#18:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each one must learn to teach that all forms of rejection are meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#18:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The separation is the notion of rejection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#18:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As long as you teach this you will believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#18:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is not as God thinks, and you must think as He thinks if you are to know Him again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"098#19\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">19.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#19:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember that the Holy Spirit is the Communication Link between God the Father and His separated Sons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#19:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you will listen to His Voice you will know that you cannot either hurt or be hurt, and that many need your blessing to help them hear this for themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"098#19:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you perceive only this need in them, and do not respond to any other, you will have learned of me and will be as eager to share your learning as I am.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"For learning purposes, let us consider the crucifixion again.
