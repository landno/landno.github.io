data-sentence-id=\"350#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Temptation has one lesson it would teach, in all its forms, wherever it occurs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It would persuade the holy Son of God he is a body, born in what must die, unable to escape its frailty, and bound by what it orders him to feel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It sets the limits on what he can do; its power is the only strength he has; his grasp cannot exceed its tiny reach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would you be this, if Christ appeared to you in all His glory, asking you but this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"350#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Choose once again if you would take your place among the saviors of the world, or would remain in hell, and hold your brothers there.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"350#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For He <i>has</i> come, and He <i>is</i> asking this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How do you make the choice?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How easily is this explained!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You always choose between your weakness and the strength of Christ in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what you choose is what you think is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Simply by never using weakness to direct your actions, you have given it no power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And the light of Christ in you is given charge of everything you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For you have brought your weakness unto Him, and He has given you His strength instead.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Trials are but lessons that you failed to learn presented once again, so where you made a faulty choice before you now can make a better one, and thus escape all pain that what you chose before has brought to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In every difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity Christ calls to you and gently says, “My brother, choose again.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He would not leave one source of pain unhealed, nor any image left to veil the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He would remove all misery from you whom God created altar unto joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He would not leave you comfortless, alone in dreams of hell, but would release your mind from everything that hides His face from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His Holiness is yours because He is the only power that is real in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His strength is yours because He is the Self that God created as His only Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The images you make cannot prevail against what God Himself would have you be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be never fearful of temptation, then, but see it as it is; another chance to choose again, and let Christ’s strength prevail in every circumstance and every place you raised an image of yourself before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what appears to hide the face of Christ is powerless before His majesty, and disappears before His holy sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The saviors of the world, who see like Him, are merely those who choose His strength instead of their own weakness, seen apart from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They will redeem the world, for they are joined in all the power of the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what they will is only what He wills.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Learn, then, the happy habit of response to all temptation to perceive yourself as weak and miserable with these words:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"350#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I am as God created me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Son can suffer nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And I <b>am</b> His Son.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"350#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus is Christ’s strength invited to prevail, replacing all your weakness with the strength that comes from God and that can never fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And thus are miracles as natural as fear and agony appeared to be before the choice for holiness was made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For in that choice are false distinctions gone, illusory alternatives laid by, and nothing left to interfere with truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You <i>are</i> as God created you, and so is every living thing you look upon, regardless of the images you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What you behold as sickness and as pain, as weakness and as suffering and loss, is but temptation to perceive yourself defenseless and in hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yield not to this, and you will see all pain, in every form, wherever it occurs, but disappear as mists before the sun.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A miracle has come to heal God’s Son, and close the door upon his dreams of weakness, opening the way to his salvation and release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Choose once again what you would have him be, remembering that every choice you make establishes your own identity as you will see it and believe it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Deny me not the little gift I ask, when in exchange I lay before your feet the peace of God, and power to bring this peace to everyone who wanders in the world uncertain, lonely, and in constant fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it is given you to join with him, and through the Christ in you unveil his eyes, and let him look upon the Christ in him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>My brothers in salvation, do not fail to hear my voice and listen to my words.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I ask for nothing but your own release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no place for hell within a world whose loveliness can yet be so intense and so inclusive it is but a step from there to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To your tired eyes I bring a vision of a different world, so new and clean and fresh you will forget the pain and sorrow that you saw before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet this a vision is which you must share with everyone you see, for otherwise you will behold it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To give this gift is how to make it yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And God ordained, in loving kindness, that it be for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us be glad that we can walk the world, and find so many chances to perceive another situation where God’s gift can once again be recognized as ours!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And thus will all the vestiges of hell, the secret sins and hidden hates be gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And all the loveliness which they concealed appear like lawns of Heaven to our sight, to lift us high above the thorny roads we travelled on before the Christ appeared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Hear me, my brothers, hear and join with me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God has ordained I cannot call in vain, and in His certainty I rest content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For you <i>will</i> hear, and you <i>will</i> choose again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in this choice is everyone made free.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I thank You, Father, for these holy ones who are my brothers as they are Your Sons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>My faith in them is Yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I am as sure that they will come to me as You are sure of what they are, and will forever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They will accept the gift I offer them, because You gave it me on their behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And as I would but do Your holy Will, so will they choose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And I give thanks for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Salvation’s song will echo through the world with every choice they make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For we are one in purpose, and the end of hell is near.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In joyous welcome is my hand outstretched to every brother who would join with me in reaching past temptation, and who looks with fixed determination toward the light that shines beyond in perfect constancy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Give me my own, for they belong to You.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And can You fail in what is but Your Will?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I give You thanks for what my brothers are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And as each one elects to join with me, the song of thanks from earth to Heaven grows from tiny scattered threads of melody to one inclusive chorus from a world redeemed from hell, and giving thanks to You.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"350#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And now we say “Amen.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For Christ has come to dwell in the abode You set for Him before time was, in calm eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The journey closes, ending at the place where it began.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No trace of it remains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Not one illusion is accorded faith, and not one spot of darkness still remains to hide the face of Christ from anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thy Will is done, complete and perfectly, and all creation recognizes You, and knows You as the only Source it has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Clear in Your likeness does the light shine forth from everything that lives and moves in You.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"350#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For we have reached where all of us are one, and we are home, where You would have us be.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Temptation has one lesson it would teach, in all its forms, wherever it occurs.
