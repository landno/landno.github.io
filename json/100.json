Attack","inlineNumber":"III."},"annotation":"T-6.III","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-6-sect-3\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"100#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As we have already emphasized, every idea begins in the mind of the thinker.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore, what extends from the mind is still in it, and from <i>what</i> it extends it knows itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The word “knows” is correct here, because the Holy Spirit still holds knowledge safe in your mind through His impartial perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By attacking nothing, He presents no barrier to the communication of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore, being is never threatened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your Godlike mind can never be defiled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ego never was and never will be part of it, but through the ego you can hear and teach and learn what is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You have taught yourself to believe that you are not what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You cannot teach what you have not learned, and what you teach you strengthen in yourself because you are sharing it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Every lesson you teach you are learning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"100#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That is why you must teach only one lesson.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you are to be conflict-free yourself, you must learn only from the Holy Spirit and teach only by Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are only love, but when you deny this, you make what you are something you must learn to remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I said before that the message of the crucifixion was, “Teach only love, for that is what you are.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the one lesson that is perfectly unified, because it is the only lesson that is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only by teaching it can you learn it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>“As you teach so will you learn.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If that is true, and it is true indeed, do not forget that what you teach is teaching you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And what you project or extend you believe.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"100#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The only safety lies in extending the Holy Spirit, because as you see His gentleness in others your own mind perceives itself as totally harmless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Once it can accept this fully, it sees no need to protect itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The protection of God then dawns upon it, assuring it that it is perfectly safe forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The perfectly safe are wholly benign.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They bless because they know that they are blessed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Without anxiety the mind is wholly kind, and because it extends beneficence it is beneficent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Safety is the complete relinquishment of attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No compromise is possible in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Teach attack in any form and you have learned it, and it will hurt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet this learning is not immortal, and you can unlearn it by not teaching it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"100#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Since you cannot <i>not</i> teach, your salvation lies in teaching the exact opposite of everything the ego believes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is how you will learn the truth that will set you free, and will keep you free as others learn it of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The only way to have peace is to teach peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By teaching peace you must learn it yourself, because you cannot teach what you still dissociate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only thus can you win back the knowledge that you threw away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>An idea that you share you must have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It awakens in your mind through the conviction of teaching it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Everything you teach you are learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"100#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Teach only love, and learn that love is yours and you are love.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"As we have already emphasized,
