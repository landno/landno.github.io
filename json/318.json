data-sentence-id=\"318#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Accepting the Atonement for yourself means not to give support to someone’s dream of sickness and of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It means that you share not his wish to separate, and let him turn illusions on himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor do you wish that they be turned, instead, on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus have they no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you are free of dreams of pain because you let him be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Unless you help him, you will suffer pain with him because that is your wish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you become a figure in his dream of pain, as he in yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>So do you and your brother both become illusions, and without identity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You could be anyone or anything, depending on whose evil dream you share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You can be sure of just one thing; that you are evil, for you share in dreams of fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"318#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a way of finding certainty right here and now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Refuse to be a part of fearful dreams whatever form they take, for you will lose identity in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You find yourself by not accepting them as causing you, and giving you effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You stand apart from them, but not apart from him who dreams them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus you separate the dreamer from the dream, and join in one, but let the other go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The dream is but illusion in the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And with the mind you would unite, but never with the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is the dream you fear, and not the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You see them as the same, because you think that <i>you</i> are but a dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And what is real and what is but illusion in yourself you do not know and cannot tell apart.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"318#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Like you, your brother thinks he is a dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Share not in his illusion of himself, for your Identity depends on his reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think, rather, of him as a mind in which illusions still persist, but as a mind which brother is to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He is not brother made by what he dreams, nor is his body, “hero” of the dream, your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is his reality that is your brother, as is yours to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your mind and his are joined in brotherhood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His body and his dreams but seem to make a little gap, where yours have joined with his.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"318#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And yet, between your minds there is no gap.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To join his dreams is thus to meet him not, because his dreams would separate from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore release him, merely by your claim on brotherhood, and not on dreams of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let him acknowledge who he is, by not supporting his illusions by your faith, for if you do, you will have faith in yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>With faith in yours, he will not be released, and you are kept in bondage to his dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And dreams of fear will haunt the little gap, inhabited but by illusions which you have supported in your brother’s mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"318#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be certain, if you do your part, he will do his, for he will join you where you stand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Call not to him to meet you in the gap between you, or you must believe that it is your reality as well as his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot do his part, but this you <i>do</i> when you become a passive figure in his dreams, instead of dreamer of your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Identity in dreams is meaningless because the dreamer and the dream are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who shares a dream must be the dream he shares, because by sharing is a cause produced.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"318#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You share confusion and you are confused, for in the gap no stable self exists.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What is the same seems different, because what is the same appears to be unlike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His dreams are yours because you let them be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But if you took your own away would he be free of them, and of his own as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your dreams are witnesses to his, and his attest the truth of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet if you see there is no truth in yours, his dreams will go, and he will understand what made the dream.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"318#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is in both your minds, and He is One because there is no gap that separates His Oneness from Itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The gap between your bodies matters not, for what is joined in Him is always one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one is sick if someone else accepts his union with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His desire to be a sick and separated mind can not remain without a witness or a cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And both are gone if someone wills to be united with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He has dreams that he was separated from his brother who, by sharing not his dream, has left the space between them vacant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And the Father comes to join His Son the Holy Spirit joined.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"318#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s function is to take the broken picture of the Son of God and put the pieces into place again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This holy picture, healed entirely, does He hold out to every separate piece that thinks it is a picture in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To each He offers his Identity, which the whole picture represents, instead of just a little, broken bit that he insisted was himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And when he sees this picture he will recognize himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you share not your brother’s evil dream, this is the picture that the miracle will place within the little gap, left clean of all the seeds of sickness and of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And here the Father will receive His Son, because His Son was gracious to himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"318#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I thank You, Father, knowing You will come to close each little gap that lies between the broken pieces of Your holy Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your Holiness, complete and perfect, lies in every one of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And they are joined because what is in one is in them all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How holy is the smallest grain of sand, when it is recognized as being part of the completed picture of God’s Son!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The forms the broken pieces seem to take mean nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the whole is in each one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And every aspect of the Son of God is just the same as every other part.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"318#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Join not your brother’s dreams but join with him, and where you join His Son the Father is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who seeks for substitutes when he perceives he has lost nothing?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who would want to have the “benefits” of sickness when he has received the simple happiness of health?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What God has given cannot be a loss, and what is not of Him has no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What, then, would you perceive within the gap?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The seeds of sickness come from the belief that there is joy in separation, and its giving up would be a sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But miracles are the result when you do not insist on seeing in the gap what is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your willingness to let illusions go is all the Healer of God’s Son requires.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He will place the miracle of healing where the seeds of sickness were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"318#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And there will be no loss, but only gain.</span></p></div>
