data-sentence-id=\"347#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The learning of the world is built upon a concept of the self adjusted to the world’s reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It fits it well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For this an image is that suits a world of shadows and illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here it walks at home, where what it sees is one with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The building of a concept of the self is what the learning of the world is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is its purpose; that you come without a self, and make one as you go along.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And by the time you reach “maturity” you have perfected it, to meet the world on equal terms, at one with its demands.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A concept of the self is made by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It bears no likeness to yourself at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is an idol, made to take the place of your reality as Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The concept of the self the world would teach is not the thing that it appears to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it is made to serve two purposes, but one of which the mind can recognize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The first presents the face of innocence, the aspect acted on.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is this face that smiles and charms and even seems to love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It searches for companions and it looks, at times with pity, on the suffering, and sometimes offers solace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It believes that it is good within an evil world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This aspect can grow angry, for the world is wicked and unable to provide the love and shelter innocence deserves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so this face is often wet with tears at the injustices the world accords to those who would be generous and good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This aspect never makes the first attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But every day a hundred little things make small assaults upon its innocence, provoking it to irritation, and at last to open insult and abuse.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The face of innocence the concept of the self so proudly wears can tolerate attack in self-defense, for is it not a well-known fact the world deals harshly with defenseless innocence?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one who makes a picture of himself omits this face, for he has need of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The other side he does not want to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it is here the learning of the world has set its sights, for it is here the world’s “reality” is set, to see to it the idol lasts.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Beneath the face of innocence there is a lesson that the concept of the self was made to teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a lesson in a terrible displacement, and a fear so devastating that the face that smiles above it must forever look away, lest it perceive the treachery it hides.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The lesson teaches this: “I am the thing you made of me, and as you look on me, you stand condemned because of what I am.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>On this conception of the self the world smiles with approval, for it guarantees the pathways of the world are safely kept, and those who walk on them will not escape.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the central lesson that ensures your brother is condemned eternally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For what you are has now become his sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For this is no forgiveness possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No longer does it matter what he does, for your accusing finger points to him, unwavering and deadly in its aim.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It points to you as well, but this is kept still deeper in the mists below the face of innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in these shrouded vaults are all his sins and yours preserved and kept in darkness, where they cannot be perceived as errors, which the light would surely show.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You can be neither blamed for what you are, nor can you change the things it makes you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your brother then is symbol of your sins to you who are but silently, and yet with ceaseless urgency, condemning still your brother for the hated thing you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Concepts are learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are not natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Apart from learning they do not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are not given, so they must be made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Not one of them is true, and many come from feverish imaginations, hot with hatred and distortions born of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What is a concept but a thought to which its maker gives a meaning of his own?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Concepts maintain the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But they can not be used to demonstrate the world is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For all of them are made within the world, born in its shadow, growing in its ways and finally “maturing” in its thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>They are ideas of idols, painted with the brushes of the world, which cannot make a single picture representing truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A concept of the self is meaningless, for no one here can see what it is for, and therefore cannot picture what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet is all learning that the world directs begun and ended with the single aim of teaching you this concept of yourself, that you will choose to follow this world’s laws, and never seek to go beyond its roads nor realize the way you see yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Now must the Holy Spirit find a way to help you see this concept of the self must be undone, if any peace of mind is to be given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor can it be unlearned except by lessons aimed to teach that you are something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For otherwise, you would be asked to make exchange of what you now believe for total loss of self, and greater terror would arise in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus are the Holy Spirit’s lesson plans arranged in easy steps, that though there be some lack of ease at times and some distress, there is no shattering of what was learned, but just a re-translation of what seems to be the evidence on its behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us consider, then, what proof there is that you are what your brother made of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For even though you do not yet perceive that this is what you think, you surely learned by now that you behave as if it were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Does he react for you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And does he know exactly what would happen?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can he see your future and ordain, before it comes, what you should do in every circumstance?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He must have made the world as well as you to have such prescience in the things to come.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That you are what your brother made of you seems most unlikely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Even if he did, who gave the face of innocence to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is this your contribution?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who is, then, the “you” who made it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And who is deceived by all your goodness, and attacks it so?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let us forget the concept’s foolishness, and merely think of this; there are two parts to what you think yourself to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If one were generated by your brother, who was there to make the other?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And from whom must something be kept hidden?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If the world be evil, there is still no need to hide what you are made of.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Who is there to see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And what but is attacked could need defense?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps the reason why this concept must be kept in darkness is that, in the light, the one who would not think it true is you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what would happen to the world you see, if all its underpinnings were removed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your concept of the world depends upon this concept of the self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And both would go, if either one were ever raised to doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit does not seek to throw you into panic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>So He merely asks if just a little question might be raised.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There are alternatives about the thing that you must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You might, for instance, be the thing you chose to have your brother be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This shifts the concept of the self from what is wholly passive, and at least makes way for active choice, and some acknowledgment that interaction must have entered in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is some understanding that you chose for both of you, and what he represents has meaning that was given it by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It also shows some glimmering of sight into perception’s law that what you see reflects the state of the perceiver’s mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet who was it that did the choosing first?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you are what you chose your brother be, alternatives were there to choose among, and someone must have first decided on the one to choose, and let the other go.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Although this step has gains, it does not yet approach a basic question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Something must have gone before these concepts of the self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And something must have done the learning which gave rise to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor can this be explained by either view.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The main advantage of the shifting to the second from the first is that you somehow entered in the choice by your decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But this gain is paid in almost equal loss, for now you stand accused of guilt for what your brother is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you must share his guilt, because you chose it for him in the image of your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>While only he was treacherous before, now must you be condemned along with him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The concept of the self has always been the great preoccupation of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And everyone believes that he must find the answer to the riddle of himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Salvation can be seen as nothing more than the escape from concepts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not concern itself with content of the mind, but with the simple statement that it thinks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what can think has choice, and can be shown that different thoughts have different consequence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>So it can learn that everything it thinks reflects the deep confusion that it feels about how it was made and what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And vaguely does the concept of the self appear to answer what it does not know.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Seek not your Self in symbols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There can be no concept that can stand for what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What matters it which concept you accept while you perceive a self that interacts with evil, and reacts to wicked things?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your concept of yourself will still remain quite meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you will not perceive that you can interact but with yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To see a guilty world is but the sign your learning has been guided by the world, and you behold it as you see yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The concept of the self embraces all you look upon, and nothing is outside of this perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you can be hurt by anything, you see a picture of your secret wishes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nothing more than this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#15:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And in your suffering of any kind you see your own concealed desire to kill.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will make many concepts of the self as learning goes along.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each one will show the changes in your own relationships, as your perception of yourself is changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There will be some confusion every time there is a shift, but be you thankful that the learning of the world is loosening its grasp upon your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And be you sure and happy in the confidence that it will go at last, and leave your mind at peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The role of the accuser will appear in many places and in many forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And each will seem to be accusing you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#16:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet have no fear it will not be undone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"347#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world can teach no images of you unless you want to learn them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There will come a time when images have all gone by, and you will see you know not what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is to this unsealed and open mind that truth returns, unhindered and unbound.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where concepts of the self have been laid by is truth revealed exactly as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When every concept has been raised to doubt and question, and been recognized as made on no assumptions that would stand the light, then is the truth left free to enter in its sanctuary, clean and free of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#17:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no statement that the world is more afraid to hear than this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"347#17:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I do not know the thing I am, and therefore do not know what I am doing, where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"347#17:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet in this learning is salvation born.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"347#17:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And What you are will tell you of Itself.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The learning of the world is built upon a concept of the self adjusted to the world’s reality.
