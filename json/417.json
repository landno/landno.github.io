class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is because the thoughts you think you think appear as images that you do not recognize them as nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You think you think them, and so you think you see them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is how your ‚Äúseeing‚Äù was made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the function you have given your body‚Äôs eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not seeing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is image making.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It takes the place of seeing, replacing vision with illusions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"417#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This introductory idea to the process of image making that you call seeing will not have much meaning for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will begin to understand it when you have seen little edges of light around the same familiar objects which you see now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is the beginning of real vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can be certain that real vision will come quickly when this has occurred.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"417#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As we go along, you may have many ‚Äúlight episodes.‚Äù</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They may take many different forms, some of them quite unexpected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not be afraid of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are signs that you are opening your eyes at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They will not persist, because they merely symbolize true perception, and they are not related to knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>These exercises will not reveal knowledge to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But they will prepare the way to it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"417#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In practicing the idea for today, repeat it first to yourself, and then apply it to whatever you see around you, using its name and letting your eyes rest on it as you say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"417#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This _________ is an image that I have made.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That _________ is an image that I have made.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"417#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not necessary to include a large number of specific subjects for the application of today‚Äôs idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is necessary, however, to continue to look at each subject while you repeat the idea to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The idea should be repeated quite slowly each time.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"417#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Although you will obviously not be able to apply the idea to very many things during the minute or so of practice that is recommended, try to make the selection as random as possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Less than a minute will do for the practice periods, if you begin to feel uneasy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not have more than three application periods for today‚Äôs idea unless you feel completely comfortable with it, and do not exceed four.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"417#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>However, the idea can be applied as needed throughout the day.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is because the thoughts you think you think appear as images that you do not recognize them as nothing.
