End","inlineNumber":"VII."},"annotation":"T-20.VII","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-20-sect-7\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"248#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have said much about discrepancies of means and end, and how these must be brought in line before your holy relationship can bring you only joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But we have also said the means to meet the Holy Spirit’s goal will come from the same Source as does His purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Being so simple and direct, this course has nothing in it that is not consistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The seeming inconsistencies, or parts you find more difficult than others, are merely indications of areas where means and end are still discrepant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this produces great discomfort.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This need not be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This course requires almost nothing of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is impossible to imagine one that asks so little, or could offer more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"248#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The period of discomfort that follows the sudden change in a relationship from sin to holiness may now be almost over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To the extent you still experience it, you are refusing to leave the means to Him Who changed the purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You recognize you want the goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Are you not also willing to accept the means?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you are not, let us admit that <i>you</i> are inconsistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A purpose is attained by means, and if you want a purpose you must be willing to want the means as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How can one be sincere and say, “I want this above all else, and yet I do not want to learn the means to get it?”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"248#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To obtain the goal the Holy Spirit indeed asks little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He asks no more to give the means as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The means are second to the goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And when you hesitate, it is because the purpose frightens you, and not the means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember this, for otherwise you will make the error of believing the means are difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet how can they be difficult if they are merely given you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They guarantee the goal, and they are perfectly in line with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Before we look at them a little closer, remember that if you think they are impossible, your wanting of the purpose has been shaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For if a goal is possible to reach, the means to do so must be possible as well.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"248#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It <i>is</i> impossible to see your brother as sinless and yet to look upon him as a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is this not perfectly consistent with the goal of holiness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For holiness is merely the result of letting the effects of sin be lifted, so what was always true is recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To see a sinless body is impossible, for holiness is positive and the body is merely neutral.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not sinful, but neither is it sinless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As nothing, which it is, the body cannot meaningfully be invested with attributes of Christ or of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Either must be an error, for both would place the attributes where they cannot be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And both must be undone for purposes of truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"248#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body <i>is</i> the means by which the ego tries to make the unholy relationship seem real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The unholy instant <i>is</i> the time of bodies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But the <i>purpose</i> here is sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It cannot be attained but in illusion, and so the illusion of a brother as a body is quite in keeping with the purpose of unholiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Because of this consistency, the means remain unquestioned while the end is cherished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Seeing adapts to wish, for sight is always secondary to desire.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And if you see the body, you have chosen judgment and not vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For vision, like relationships, has no order.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You either see or not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"248#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who sees a brother’s body has laid a judgment on him, and sees him not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He does not really see him as sinful; he does not see him at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In the darkness of sin he is invisible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He can but be imagined in the darkness, and it is here that the illusions you hold about him are not held up to his reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here are illusions and reality kept separated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here are illusions never brought to truth, and always hidden from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And here, in darkness, is your brother’s reality imagined as a body, in unholy relationships with other bodies, serving the cause of sin an instant before he dies.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"248#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is indeed a difference between this vain imagining and vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The difference lies not in them, but in their purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Both are but means, each one appropriate to the end for which it is employed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Neither can serve the purpose of the other, for each one is a <i>choice</i> of purpose, employed on its behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Either is meaningless without the end for which it was intended, nor is it valued as a separate thing apart from the intention.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The means seem real because the goal is valued.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And judgment has no value unless the goal is sin.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"248#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body cannot be looked upon except through judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To see the body is the sign that you lack vision, and have denied the means the Holy Spirit offers you to serve His purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How can a holy relationship achieve its purpose through the means of sin?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Judgment you taught yourself; vision is learned from Him Who would undo your teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His vision cannot see the body because it cannot look on sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And thus it leads you to reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your holy brother, sight of whom is your release, is no illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Attempt to see him not in darkness, for your imaginings about him will seem real there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You closed your eyes to shut him out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Such was your purpose, and while this purpose seems to have a meaning, the means for its attainment will be evaluated as worth the seeing, and so you will not see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"248#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your question should not be, “How can I see my brother without the body?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Ask only, “Do I really wish to see him sinless?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And as you ask, forget not that his sinlessness is <i>your</i> escape from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation is the Holy Spirit’s goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The means is vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For what the seeing look upon <i>is</i> sinless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one who loves can judge, and what he sees is free of condemnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"248#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And what he sees he did not make, for it was given him to see, as was the vision that made his seeing possible.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"We have said much about
