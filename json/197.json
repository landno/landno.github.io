<span data-sentence-id=\"197#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant does not replace the need for learning, for the Holy Spirit must not leave you as your Teacher until the holy

<span data-sentence-id=\"197#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Hear Him gladly, and learn of Him that you have need of no special relationships at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You but seek in them what you have thrown away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And through them you will never learn the value of what you have cast aside, but still desire with all your heart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let us join together in making the holy instant all that there is, by desiring that it <i>be</i> all that there is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s Son has such great need of your willingness to strive for this that you cannot conceive of need so great.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Behold the only need that God and His Son share, and will to meet together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are not alone in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The will of your creations calls to you, to share your will with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Turn, then, in peace from guilt to God and them.</span></p></div> <div

what you can never leave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The loneliness of God’s Son is the loneliness of his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Refuse not the awareness of your completion, and seek not to restore it to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fear not to give redemption over to your Redeemer’s Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He will not fail you, for He comes from One Who cannot fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Accept your sense of failure as nothing more than a mistake in who you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For the holy host of God is beyond failure, and nothing that he wills can be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You are forever in a relationship so holy that it calls to everyone to escape from loneliness, and join you in your love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And where you are must everyone seek, and find you there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"197#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think but an instant on this: God gave the Sonship to you, to ensure your perfect creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This was His gift, for as He withheld Himself not from you, He withheld not His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing that ever was created but is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your relationships are with the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this universe, being of God, is far beyond the petty sum of all the separate bodies you perceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For all its parts are joined in God through Christ, where they become like to their Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Christ knows of no separation from His Father, Who is His one relationship, in which He gives as His Father gives to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"197#5\"><p

understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And because of the Source of the attempt, it will succeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit asks you to respond as God does, for He would teach you what you do not understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God would respond to every need, whatever form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so He keeps this channel open to receive His communication to you, and yours to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God does not understand your problem in communication, for He does not share it with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is only you who believe that it is understandable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Holy Spirit knows that it is not understandable, and yet He understands it because you made it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"197#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the Holy Spirit alone lies the awareness of what God cannot know, and what you do not understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is His holy function to accept them both, and by removing every element of disagreement, to join them into one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He will do this because it is His function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Leave, then, what seems to you to be impossible, to Him Who knows it must be possible because it is the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And let Him Whose teaching is only of God teach you the only meaning of relationships.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"197#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For God created the only relationship that has meaning, and that is His relationship with you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The holy instant does not replace the need for learning, for the Holy Spirit must not leave you as your Teacher until the holy instant has
