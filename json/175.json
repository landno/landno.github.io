data-sentence-id=\"175#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgetfulness and sleep and even death become the ego’s best advice for dealing with the perceived and harsh intrusion of guilt on peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet no one sees himself in conflict and ravaged by a cruel war unless he believes that both opponents in the war are real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Believing this he must escape, for such a war would surely end his peace of mind, and so destroy him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet if he could but realize the war is between real and unreal powers, he could look upon himself and see his freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one finds himself ravaged and torn in endless battles if he himself perceives them as wholly without meaning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God would not have His Son embattled, and so His Son’s imagined “enemy” is totally unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are but trying to escape a bitter war from which you <i>have</i> escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The war is gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you have heard the hymn of freedom rising unto Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Gladness and joy belong to God for your release, because you made it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet as you made not freedom, so you made not a war that could endanger freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing destructive ever was or will be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The war, the guilt, the past are gone as one into the unreality from which they came.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When we are all united in Heaven, you will value nothing that you value here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For nothing that you value here do you value wholly, and so you do not value it at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Value is where God placed it, and the value of what God esteems cannot be judged, for it has been established.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is wholly of value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It can merely be appreciated or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To value it partially is not to know its value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In Heaven is everything God values, and nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Heaven is perfectly unambiguous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Everything is clear and bright, and calls forth one response.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>There is no darkness and there is no contrast.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>There is no variation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>There is no interruption.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#3:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>There is a sense of peace so deep that no dream in this world has ever brought even a dim imagining of what it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing in this world can give this peace, for nothing in this world is wholly shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perfect perception can merely show you what is capable of being wholly shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It can also show you the results of sharing, while you still remember the results of not sharing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit points quietly to the contrast, knowing that you will finally let Him judge the difference for you, allowing Him to demonstrate which must be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has perfect faith in your final judgment, because He knows that He will make it for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To doubt this would be to doubt that His mission will be fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How is this possible, when His mission is of God?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You whose mind is darkened by doubt and guilt, remember this: God gave the Holy Spirit to you, and gave Him the mission to remove all doubt and every trace of guilt that His dear Son has laid upon himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is impossible that this mission fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing can prevent what God would have accomplished from accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whatever your reactions to the Holy Spirit’s Voice may be, whatever voice you choose to listen to, whatever strange thoughts may occur to you, God’s Will <i>is</i> done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will find the peace in which He has established you, because He does not change His Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is invariable as the peace in which you dwell, and of which the Holy Spirit reminds you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will not remember change and shift in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have need of contrast only here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Contrast and differences are necessary teaching aids, for by them you learn what to avoid and what to seek.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you have learned this, you will find the answer that makes the need for any differences disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Truth comes of its own will unto its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you have learned that you belong to truth, it will flow lightly over you without a difference of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For you will need no contrast to help you realize that this is what you want, and only this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Fear not the Holy Spirit will fail in what your Father has given Him to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The Will of God can fail in nothing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Have faith in only this one thing, and it will be sufficient: God wills you be in Heaven, and nothing can keep you from it, or it from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your wildest misperceptions, your weird imaginings, your blackest nightmares all mean nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They will not prevail against the peace God wills for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit will restore your sanity because insanity is not the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If that suffices Him, it is enough for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will not keep what God would have removed, because it breaks communication with you with whom He would communicate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His Voice <i>will</i> be heard.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Communication Link that God Himself placed within you, joining your mind with His, cannot be broken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may believe you want It broken, and this belief does interfere with the deep peace in which the sweet and constant communication God would share with you is known.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet His channels of reaching out cannot be wholly closed and separated from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Peace will be yours because His peace still flows to you from Him Whose Will is peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have it now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit will teach you how to use it, and by extending it, to learn that it is in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God willed you Heaven, and will always will you nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Holy Spirit knows only of His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There is no chance that Heaven will not be yours, for God is sure, and what He wills is as sure as He is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will learn salvation because you will learn how to save.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It will not be possible to exempt yourself from what the Holy Spirit wants to teach you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Salvation is as sure as God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His certainty suffices.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Learn that even the darkest nightmare that disturbs the mind of God’s sleeping Son holds no power over him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He will learn the lesson of awaking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God watches over him and light surrounds him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Can God’s Son lose himself in dreams, when God has placed within him the glad Call to waken and be glad?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He cannot separate himself from what is in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His sleep will not withstand the Call to wake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The mission of redemption will be fulfilled as surely as the creation will remain unchanged throughout eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not have to know that Heaven is yours to make it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It <i>is</i> so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet to know it, the Will of God must be accepted as your will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"175#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit will undo for you everything you have learned that teaches that what is not true must be reconciled with truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the reconciliation the ego would substitute for your reconciliation to sanity and to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit has a very different kind of reconciliation in His Mind for you, and one He will effect as surely as the ego will not effect what it attempts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Failure is of the ego, not of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>From Him you cannot wander, and there is no possibility that the plan the Holy Spirit offers <i>to</i> everyone, for the salvation <i>of</i> everyone, will not be perfectly accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will be released, and you will not remember anything you made that was not created for you and by you in return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For how can you remember what was never true, or not remember what has always been?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"175#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is this reconciliation with truth, and only truth, in which the peace of Heaven lies.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Forgetfulness and sleep and even death become the ego’s best advice for dealing with the perceived and harsh intrusion of guilt on peace.
