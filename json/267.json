<span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do you want freedom of the body or of the mind?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For both you cannot have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Which do you value?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Which is your goal?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For one you see as means; the other, end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And one must serve the other and lead to its predominance, increasing its importance by diminishing its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Means serve the end, and as the end is reached the value of the means decreases, eclipsed entirely when they are recognized as functionless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No one but yearns for freedom and tries to find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet he will seek for it where he believes it is and can be found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He will believe it possible of mind or body, and he will make the other serve his choice as means to find it.</span></p></div> <div

mind is used as means whose value lies in its ability to contrive ways to achieve the body’s freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet freedom of the body has no meaning, and so the mind is dedicated to serve illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is a situation so contradictory and so impossible that anyone who chooses this has no idea of what is valuable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet even in this confusion, so profound it cannot be described, the Holy Spirit waits in gentle patience, as certain of the outcome as He is sure of His Creator’s Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He knows this mad decision was made by one as dear to His Creator as love is to itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"267#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#3:1\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"267#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But be you rather grateful that you can be the means to serve His end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the only service that leads to freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To serve this end the body must be perceived as sinless, because the goal is sinlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The lack of contradiction makes the soft transition from means to end as easy as is the shift from hate to gratitude before forgiving eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will be sanctified by your brother, using your body only to serve the sinless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it will be impossible for you to hate what serves whom you would heal.</span></p></div> <div

mighty in strength, and blazing with a light far brighter than the sun that lights the sky you see, is chosen of your Father as a means for His Own plan.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be thankful that it serves yours not at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing entrusted to it can be misused, and nothing given it but will be used.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This holy relationship has the power to heal all pain, regardless of its form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Neither you nor your brother alone can serve at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only in your joint will does healing lie.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For here your healing is, and here will you accept Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And in your healing is the Sonship healed <i>because</i> your will and your brother’s are joined.</span></p></div> <div

sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The form of error is no longer seen, and reason, joined with love, looks quietly on all confusion, observing merely, “This was a mistake.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And then the same Atonement you accepted in your relationship corrects the error, and lays a part of Heaven in its place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How blessed are you who let this gift be given!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each part of Heaven that you bring is given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And every empty place in Heaven that you fill again with the eternal light you bring, shines now on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The means of sinlessness can know no fear because they carry only love with them.</span></p></div> <div

you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The light you bring you do not recognize, and yet you will remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who can deny himself the vision that he brings to others?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And who would fail to recognize a gift he let be laid in Heaven through himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The gentle service that you give the Holy Spirit is service to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You who are now His means must love all that He loves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And what you bring is your remembrance of everything that is eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No trace of anything in time can long remain in a mind that serves the timeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And no illusion can disturb the peace of a relationship that has become the means of peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"267#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have looked upon your brother with complete forgiveness, from which no error is excluded and nothing kept hidden, what mistake can there be anywhere you cannot overlook?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#7:2\"><span

there be you will not recognize as a mistake; a shadow through which you walk completely undismayed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God would let nothing interfere with those whose wills are His, and they will recognize their wills are His, <i>because</i> they serve His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And serve it willingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And could remembrance of what they are be long delayed?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"267#8\"><p

he beholds his savior in place of the attacker who he thought was there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Through this releasing is the world released.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is your part in bringing peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you have asked what is your function here, and have been answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Seek not to change it, nor to substitute another goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This one was given you, and only this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Accept this one and serve it willingly, for what the Holy Spirit does with gifts you give your brother, to whom He offers them, and where and when, is up to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He will bestow them where they are received and welcomed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He will use every one of them for peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Nor will one little smile or willingness to overlook the tiniest mistake be lost to anyone.</span></p></div> <div

what your Father loves with charity?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Extension of forgiveness is the Holy Spirit’s function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Leave this to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let your concern be only that you give to Him that which can be extended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Save no dark secrets that He cannot use, but offer Him the tiny gifts He can extend forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He will take each one and make of it a potent force for peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He will withhold no blessing from it, nor limit it in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He will join to it all the power that God has given Him, to make each little gift of love a source of healing for everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Each little gift you offer to your brother lights up the world.</span> <span

class=\"snr\">11</span>And let the darkness be dispelled by Him Who knows the light, and lays it gently in each quiet smile of faith and confidence with which you bless your brother.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"267#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>On your learning depends the welfare of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it is only arrogance that would deny the power of your will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think you the Will of God is powerless?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is this humility?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not see what this belief has done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You see yourself as vulnerable, frail and easily destroyed, and at the mercy of countless attackers more powerful than you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let us look straight at how this error came about, for here lies buried the heavy anchor that seems to keep the fear of God in place, immovable and solid as a rock.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>While this remains, so will it seem to be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"267#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who can attack the Son of God and not attack his Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How can God’s Son be weak and frail and easily destroyed unless his Father is?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not see that every sin and every condemnation that you perceive and justify <i>is</i> an attack upon your Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And that is why it has not happened, nor could be real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not see that this is your attempt because you think the Father and the Son are separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you must think that They are separate, because of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For it seems safer to attack another or yourself than to attack the great Creator of the universe, Whose power you know.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"267#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you were one with God and recognized this oneness, you would know His power is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But you will not remember this while you believe attack of any kind means anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is unjustified in any form, because it has no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The only way it could be justified is if you and your brother were separate from the other, and all were separate from your Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For only then would it be possible to attack a part of the creation without the whole, the Son without the Father; and to attack another without yourself, or hurt yourself without the other feeling pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And this belief you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet wherein lies its value, except in the desire to attack in safety?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Attack is neither safe nor dangerous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And this is so because the universe is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You would not choose attack on its reality if it were not essential to attack to see it separated from its maker.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#12:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And thus it seems as if love could attack and become fearful.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"267#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only the different can attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So you conclude <i>because</i> you can attack, you and your brother must be different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet does the Holy Spirit explain this differently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span><i>Because</i> you and your brother are not different, you cannot attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Either position is a logical conclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Either could be maintained, but never both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The only question to be answered in order to decide which must be true is whether you and your brother are different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>From the position of what you understand you seem to be, and therefore can attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Of the alternatives, this seems more natural and more in line with your experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#13:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And therefore it is necessary that you have other experiences, more in line with truth, to teach you what <i>is</i> natural and true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"267#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the function of your holy relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For what one thinks, the other will experience with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What can this mean except your mind and your brother’s are one?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Look not with fear upon this happy fact, and think not that it lays a heavy burden on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For when you have accepted it with gladness, you will realize that your relationship is a reflection of the union of the Creator and His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>From loving minds there <i>is</i> no separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And every thought in one brings gladness to the other because they are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Joy is unlimited, because each shining thought of love extends its being and creates more of itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#14:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There is no difference anywhere in it, for every thought is like itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"267#15\"><p

because it joins you and him, so it makes you and him one with your Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And in Him is all creation joined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you regret you cannot fear alone, when your relationship can also teach the power of love is there, which makes all fear impossible?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not attempt to keep a little of the ego with this gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it was given you to be used, and not obscured.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What teaches you that you cannot separate denies the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"267#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let truth decide if you and your brother be different or the same, and teach you which is true.</span></p></div>
