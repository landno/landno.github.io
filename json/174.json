data-sentence-id=\"174#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are accustomed to the notion that the mind can see the source of pain where it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The doubtful service of such displacement is to hide the real source of guilt, and keep from your awareness the full perception that it is insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Displacement always is maintained by the illusion that the source of guilt, from which attention is diverted, must be true; and must be fearful, or you would not have displaced the guilt onto what you believed to be less fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are therefore willing to look upon all kinds of “sources,” provided they are not the deeper source to which they bear no real relationship at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Insane ideas have no real relationships, for that is why they are insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No real relationship can rest on guilt, or even hold one spot of it to mar its purity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For all relationships that guilt has touched are used but to avoid the person <i>and</i> the guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What strange relationships you have made for this strange purpose!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you forgot that real relationships are holy, and cannot be used by you at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They are used only by the Holy Spirit, and it is that which makes them pure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you displace your guilt upon them, the Holy Spirit cannot use them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For, by pre-empting for your own ends what you should have given Him, He cannot use it for your release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>No one who would unite in any way with anyone for his individual salvation will find it in that strange relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is not shared, and so it is not real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In any union with a brother in which you seek to lay your guilt upon him, or share it with him or perceive his own, <i>you</i> will feel guilty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor will you find satisfaction and peace with him, because your union with him is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will see guilt in that relationship because you put it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is inevitable that those who suffer guilt will attempt to displace it, because they do believe in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet though they suffer, they will not look within and let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They cannot know they love, and cannot understand what loving is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Their main concern is to perceive the source of guilt outside themselves, beyond their own control.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you maintain that you are guilty but the source of your guilt lies in the past, you are not looking inward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The past is not <i>in</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your weird associations to it have no meaning in the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you let them stand between you and your brothers, with whom you find no real relationships at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can you expect to use your brothers as a means to “solve” the past, and still to see them as they really are?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Salvation is not found by those who use their brothers to resolve problems that are not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You wanted not salvation in the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Would you impose your idle wishes on the present, and hope to find salvation now?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Determine, then, to be not as you were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Use no relationship to hold you to the past, but with each one each day be born again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A minute, even less, will be enough to free you from the past, and give your mind in peace over to the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When everyone is welcome to you as you would have yourself be welcome to your Father, you will see no guilt in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For you will have accepted the Atonement, which shone within you all the while you dreamed of guilt, and would not look within and see it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As long as you believe that guilt is justified in any way, in anyone, whatever he may do, you will not look within, where you would always find Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The end of guilt will never come as long as you believe there is a reason for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For you must learn that guilt is always totally insane, and has no reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit seeks not to dispel reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If guilt were real, Atonement would not be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The purpose of Atonement is to dispel illusions, not to establish them as real and then forgive them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit does not keep illusions in your mind to frighten you, and show them to you fearfully to demonstrate what He has saved you from.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What He has saved you from is gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Give no reality to guilt, and see no reason for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit does what God would have Him do, and has always done so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has seen separation, but knows of union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He teaches healing, but He also knows of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He would have you see and teach as He does, and through Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet what He knows you do not know, though it is yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"174#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As yet it is not now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Son of God believes that he is lost in guilt, alone in a dark world where pain is pressing everywhere upon him from without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When he has looked within and seen the radiance there, he will remember how much his Father loves him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it will seem incredible that he ever thought his Father loved him not, and looked upon him as condemned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The moment that you realize guilt is insane, wholly unjustified and wholly without reason, you will not fear to look upon the Atonement and accept it wholly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who have been unmerciful to yourself do not remember your Father’s Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And looking without mercy upon your brothers, you do not remember how much you love Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it is forever true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In shining peace within you is the perfect purity in which you were created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Fear not to look upon the lovely truth in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Look through the cloud of guilt that dims your vision, and look past darkness to the holy place where you will see the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The altar to your Father is as pure as He Who raised it to Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nothing can keep from you what Christ would have you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>His Will is like His Father’s, and He offers mercy to every child of God, as He would have you do.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Release from guilt as you would be released.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no other way to look within and see the light of love, shining as steadily and as surely as God Himself has always loved His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span><i>And as His Son loves Him.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no fear in love, for love is guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You who have always loved your Father can have no fear, for any reason, to look within and see your holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot be as you believed you were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your guilt is without reason because it is not in the Mind of God, where you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And this <i>is</i> reason, which the Holy Spirit would restore to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He would remove only illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>All else He would have you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And in Christ’s vision He would show you the perfect purity that is forever within God’s Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"174#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot enter into real relationships with any of God’s Sons unless you love them all and equally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love is not special.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you single out part of the Sonship for your love, you are imposing guilt on all your relationships and making them unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can love only as God loves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Seek not to love unlike Him, for there is no love apart from His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Until you recognize that this is true, you will have no idea what love is like.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one who condemns a brother can see himself as guiltless and in the peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If he is guiltless and in peace and sees it not, he is delusional, and has not looked upon himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To him I say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Behold the Son of God, and look upon his purity and be still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#11:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>In quiet look upon his holiness, and offer thanks unto his Father that no guilt has ever touched him.</span></p></div> <div

him has touched his innocence in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His shining purity, wholly untouched by guilt and wholly loving, is bright within you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let us look upon him together and love him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For in love of him is your guiltlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But look upon yourself, and gladness and appreciation for what you see will banish guilt forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I thank You, Father, for the purity of Your most holy Son, whom You have created guiltless forever.</span></p></div>

centered on what I treasure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The difference is that I love <i>only</i> what God loves with me, and because of this I treasure you beyond the value that you set on yourself, even unto the worth that God has placed upon you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I love all that He created, and all my faith and my belief I offer unto it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>My faith in you is as strong as all the love I give my Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>My trust in you is without limit, and without the fear that you will hear me not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I thank the Father for your loveliness, and for the many gifts that you will let me offer to the Kingdom in honor of its wholeness that is of God.</span></p></div> <div

His Own Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Alone we are all lowly, but together we shine with brightness so intense that none of us alone can even think of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Before the glorious radiance of the Kingdom guilt melts away, and transformed into kindness will never more be what it was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Every reaction you experience will be so purified that it is fitting as a hymn of praise unto your Father.</span> <span

class=\"snr\">6</span>United in this praise we stand before the gates of Heaven where we will surely enter in our sinlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God loves you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"174#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Could I, then, lack faith in you and love Him perfectly?</span></p></div>
