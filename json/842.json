class=\"acim-text manual-27\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"842#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Death is the central dream from which all illusions stem.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is it not madness to think of life as being born, aging, losing vitality, and dying in the end?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We have asked this question before, but now we need to consider it more carefully.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the one fixed, unchangeable belief of the world that all things in it are born only to die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is regarded as “the way of nature,” not to be raised to question, but to be accepted as the “natural” law of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The cyclical, the changing and unsure; the undependable and the unsteady, waxing and waning in a certain way upon a certain path,—all this is taken as the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And no one asks if a benign Creator could will this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"842#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this perception of the universe as God created it, it would be impossible to think of Him as loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For who has decreed that all things pass away, ending in dust and disappointment and despair, can but be feared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He holds your little life in his hand but by a thread, ready to break it off without regret or care, perhaps today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Or if he waits, yet is the ending certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who loves such a god knows not of love, because he has denied that life is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Death has become life’s symbol.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His world is now a battleground, where contradiction reigns and opposites make endless war.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Where there is death is peace impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"842#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Death is the symbol of the fear of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His Love is blotted out in the idea, which holds it from awareness like a shield held up to obscure the sun.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The grimness of the symbol is enough to show it cannot coexist with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It holds an image of the Son of God in which he is “laid to rest” in devastation’s arms, where worms wait to greet him and to last a little while by his destruction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the worms as well are doomed to be destroyed as certainly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And so do all things live because of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Devouring is nature’s “law of life.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God is insane, and fear alone is real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"842#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The curious belief that there is part of dying things that may go on apart from what will die, does not proclaim a loving God nor re-establish any grounds for trust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If death is real for anything, there is no life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Death denies life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But if there is reality in life, death is denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No compromise in this is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is either a god of fear or One of Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The world attempts a thousand compromises, and will attempt a thousand more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Not one can be acceptable to God’s teachers, because not one could be acceptable to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He did not make death because He did not make fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Both are equally meaningless to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"842#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The “reality” of death is firmly rooted in the belief that God’s Son is a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And if God created bodies, death would indeed be real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But God would not be loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no point at which the contrast between the perception of the real world and that of the world of illusions becomes more sharply evident.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Death is indeed the death of God, if He is Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And now His Own creation must stand in fear of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He is not Father, but destroyer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is not Creator, but avenger.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Terrible His Thoughts and fearful His image.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>To look on His creations is to die.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"842#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>“And the last to be overcome will be death.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Of course!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Without the idea of death there is no world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All dreams will end with this one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is salvation’s final goal; the end of all illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in death are all illusions born.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What can be born of death and still have life?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But what is born of God and still can die?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The inconsistencies, the compromises and the rituals the world fosters in its vain attempts to cling to death and yet to think love real are mindless magic, ineffectual and meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God is, and in Him all created things must be eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Do you not see that otherwise He has an opposite, and fear would be as real as love?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"842#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Teacher of God, your one assignment could be stated thus: Accept no compromise in which death plays a part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not believe in cruelty, nor let attack conceal the truth from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What seems to die has but been misperceived and carried to illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now it becomes your task to let the illusion be carried to the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be steadfast but in this; be not deceived by the “reality” of any changing form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Truth neither moves nor wavers nor sinks down to death and dissolution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And what is the end of death?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nothing but this; the realization that the Son of God is guiltless now and forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nothing but this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"842#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But do not let yourself forget it is not less than this.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Death is the central dream from which all illusions stem.
