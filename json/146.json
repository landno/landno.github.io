Fatherhood","inlineNumber":"I."},"annotation":"T-11.I","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-11-sect-1\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have learned your need of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you bring anything else to the Sonship, recognizing your need of healing for yourself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For in this lies the beginning of the return to knowledge; the foundation on which God will help build again the thought system you share with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Not one stone you place upon it but will be blessed by Him, for you will be restoring the holy dwelling place of His Son, where He wills His Son to be and where he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In whatever part of the mind of God’s Son you restore this reality, you restore it to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You dwell in the Mind of God with your brother, for God Himself did not will to be alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To be alone is to be separated from infinity, but how can this be if infinity has no end?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one can be beyond the limitless, because what has no limits must be everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There are no beginnings and no endings in God, Whose universe is Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Can you exclude yourself from the universe, or from God Who <i>is</i> the universe?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I and my Father are one with you, for you are part of Us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do you really believe that part of God can be missing or lost to Him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you were not part of God, His Will would not be unified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is this conceivable?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Can part of His Mind contain nothing?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If your place in His Mind cannot be filled by anyone except you, and your filling it was your creation, without you there would be an empty place in God’s Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Extension cannot be blocked, and it has no voids.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It continues forever, however much it is denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your denial of its reality may arrest it in time, but not in eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>That is why your creations have not ceased to be extended, and why so much is waiting for your return.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Waiting is possible only in time, but time has no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You who made delay can leave time behind simply by recognizing that neither beginnings nor endings were created by the Eternal, Who placed no limits on His creation or upon those who create like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not know this simply because you have tried to limit what He created, and so you believe that all creation is limited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How, then, could you know your creations, having denied infinity?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The laws of the universe do not permit contradiction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What holds for God holds for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you believe you are absent from God, you will believe that He is absent from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Infinity is meaningless without you, and you are meaningless without God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no end to God and His Son, for we <i>are</i> the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God is not incomplete, and He is not childless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Because He did not will to be alone, He created a Son like Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not deny Him His Son, for your unwillingness to accept His Fatherhood has denied you yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>See His creations as His Son, for yours were created in honor of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The universe of love does not stop because you do not see it, nor have your closed eyes lost the ability to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Look upon the glory of His creation, and you will learn what God has kept for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God has given you a place in His Mind that is yours forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you can keep it only by giving it, as it was given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Could you be alone there, when it was given you because God did not will to be alone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God’s Mind cannot be lessened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It can only be increased, for everything He creates has the function of creating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Love does not limit, and what it creates is not limited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To give without limit is God’s Will for you, because only this can bring you the joy that is His and that He wills to share with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your love is as boundless as His because it <i>is</i> His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Could any part of God be without His Love, and could any part of His Love be contained?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God is your heritage, because His one gift is Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How can you give except like Him if you would know His gift to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Give, then, without limit and without end, to learn how much He has given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your ability to accept Him depends on your willingness to give as He gives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your fatherhood and your Father are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God wills to create, and your will is His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It follows, then, that you will to create, since your will follows from His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And being an extension of His Will, yours must be the same.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet what you will you do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not strange when you realize that to deny is to “not know.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s Will is that you are His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By denying this you deny your own will, and therefore do not know what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You must ask what God’s Will is in everything, because it is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not know what it is, but the Holy Spirit remembers it for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Ask Him, therefore, what God’s Will is for you, and He will tell you yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It cannot be too often repeated that you do not know it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Whenever what the Holy Spirit tells you appears to be coercive, it is only because you have not recognized your will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The projection of the ego makes it appear as if God’s Will is outside yourself, and therefore not yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this interpretation it seems possible for God’s Will and yours to conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God, then, may seem to demand of you what you do not want to give, and thus deprive you of what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would God, Who wants only your will, be capable of this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your will is His life, which He has given to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Even in time you cannot live apart from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Sleep is not death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What He created can sleep, but cannot die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Immortality is His Will for His Son, and His Son’s will for himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God’s Son cannot will death for himself because his Father is life, and His Son is like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Creation is your will <i>because</i> it is His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot be happy unless you do what you will truly, and you cannot change this because it is immutable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is immutable by God’s Will and yours, for otherwise His Will would not be extended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are afraid to know God’s Will, because you believe it is not yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This belief is your whole sickness and your whole fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Every symptom of sickness and fear arises here, because this is the belief that makes you <i>want</i> not to know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Believing this you hide in darkness, denying that the light is in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"146#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are asked to trust the Holy Spirit only because He speaks for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is the Voice for God, but never forget that God did not will to be alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He shares His Will with you; He does not thrust it upon you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Always remember that what He gives He keeps, so that nothing He gives can contradict Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You who share His life must share it to know it, for sharing <i>is</i> knowing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Blessed are you who learn that to hear the Will of your Father is to know your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For it is your will to be like Him, Whose Will it is that it be so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God’s Will is that His Son be one, and united with Him in His Oneness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"146#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That is why healing is the beginning of the recognition that your will is His.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You have learned your need of healing.
