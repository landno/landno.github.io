data-sentence-id=\"143#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The rituals of the god of sickness are strange and very demanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Joy is never permitted, for depression is the sign of allegiance to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Depression means that you have forsworn God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Many are afraid of blasphemy, but they do not understand what it means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They do not realize that to deny God is to deny their own Identity, and in this sense the wages of sin <i>is</i> death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The sense is very literal; denial of life perceives its opposite, as all forms of denial replace what is with what is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one can really do this, but that you can think you can and believe you have is beyond dispute.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not forget, however, that to deny God will inevitably result in projection, and you will believe that others and not yourself have done this to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You must receive the message you give because it is the message you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You may believe that you judge your brothers by the messages they give you, but you have judged them by the message you give to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not attribute your denial of joy to them, or you cannot see the spark in them that would bring joy to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the denial of the spark that brings depression, for whenever you see your brothers without it, you are denying God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Allegiance to the denial of God is the ego’s religion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The god of sickness obviously demands the denial of health, because health is in direct opposition to its own survival.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But consider what this means to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Unless you are sick you cannot keep the gods you made, for only in sickness could you possibly want them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Blasphemy, then, is <i>self</i>-destructive, not God-destructive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It means that you are willing not to know yourself in order to be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the offering your god demands because, having made him out of your insanity, he is an insane idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He has many forms, but although he may seem to be many different things he is but one idea;—the denial of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness and death seemed to enter the mind of God’s Son against His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The “attack on God” made His Son think he was Fatherless, and out of his depression he made the god of depression.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This was his alternative to joy, because he would not accept the fact that, although he was a creator, he had been created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the Son <i>is</i> helpless without the Father, Who alone is his Help.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I said before that of yourself you can do nothing, but you are not <i>of</i> yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you were, what you have made would be true, and you could never escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is because you did not make yourself that you need be troubled over nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your gods are nothing, because your Father did not create them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You cannot make creators who are unlike your Creator, any more than He could have created a Son who was unlike Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If creation is sharing, it cannot create what is unlike itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It can share only what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Depression is isolation, and so it could not have been created.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Son of God, you have not sinned, but you have been much mistaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet this can be corrected and God will help you, knowing that you could not sin against Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You denied Him because you loved Him, knowing that if you recognized your love for Him, you could not deny Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your denial of Him therefore means that you love Him, and that you know He loves you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember that what you deny you must have once known.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if you accept denial, you can accept its undoing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your Father has not denied you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He does not retaliate, but He does call to you to return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you think He has not answered your call, you have not answered His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He calls to you from every part of the Sonship, because of His Love for His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you hear His message He has answered you, and you will learn of Him if you hear aright.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Love of God is in everything He created, for His Son is everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Look with peace upon your brothers, and God will come rushing into your heart in gratitude for your gift to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not look to the god of sickness for healing but only to the God of love, for healing is the acknowledgment of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you acknowledge Him you will know that He has never ceased to acknowledge you, and that in His acknowledgment of you lies your being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are not sick and you cannot die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But you can confuse yourself with things that do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember, though, that to do this is blasphemy, for it means that you are looking without love on God and His creation, from which He cannot be separated.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only the eternal can be loved, for love does not die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What is of God is His forever, and you are of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would He allow Himself to suffer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And would He offer His Son anything that is not acceptable to Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you will accept yourself as God created you, you will be incapable of suffering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet to do this you must acknowledge Him as your Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is not because you will be punished otherwise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is merely because your acknowledgment of your Father is the acknowledgment of yourself as you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your Father created you wholly without sin, wholly without pain and wholly without suffering of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If you deny Him you bring sin, pain and suffering into your own mind because of the power He gave it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Your mind is capable of creating worlds, but it can also deny what it creates because it is free.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not realize how much you have denied yourself, and how much God, in His Love, would not have it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet He would not interfere with you, because He would not know His Son if he were not free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To interfere with you would be to attack Himself, and God is not insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you deny Him <i>you</i> are insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would you have Him share your insanity?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God will never cease to love His Son, and His Son will never cease to love Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That was the condition of His Son’s creation, fixed forever in the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To know that is sanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To deny it is insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God gave Himself to you in your creation, and His gifts are eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Would you deny yourself to Him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Out of your gifts to Him the Kingdom will be restored to His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His Son removed himself from His gift by refusing to accept what had been created for him, and what he had created in the Name of his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Heaven waits for his return, for it was created as the dwelling place of God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are not at home anywhere else, or in any other condition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not deny yourself the joy that was created for you for the misery you have made for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God has given you the means for undoing what you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Listen, and you will learn how to remember what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If God knows His children as wholly sinless, it is blasphemous to perceive them as guilty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If God knows His children as wholly without pain, it is blasphemous to perceive suffering anywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If God knows His children to be wholly joyous, it is blasphemous to feel depressed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All of these illusions, and the many other forms that blasphemy may take, are refusals to accept creation as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If God created His Son perfect, that is how you must learn to see him to learn of his reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And as part of the Sonship, that is how you must see yourself to learn of yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not perceive anything God did not create or you are denying Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His is the only Fatherhood, and it is yours only because He has given it to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your gifts to yourself are meaningless, but your gifts to your creations are like His, because they are given in His Name.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is why your creations are as real as His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the real Fatherhood must be acknowledged if the real Son is to be known.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You believe that the sick things you have made are your real creations, because you believe that the sick images you perceive are the Sons of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only if you accept the Fatherhood of God will you have anything, because His Fatherhood gave you everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>That is why to deny Him is to deny yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"143#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Arrogance is the denial of love, because love shares and arrogance withholds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As long as both appear to you to be desirable the concept of choice, which is not of God, will remain with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>While this is not true in eternity it <i>is</i> true in time, so that while time lasts in your mind there will be choices.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Time itself is your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you would remember eternity, you must look only on the eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you allow yourself to become preoccupied with the temporal, you are living in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As always, your choice is determined by what you value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Time and eternity cannot both be real, because they contradict each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"143#14:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If you will accept only what is timeless as real, you will begin to understand eternity and make it yours.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The rituals of the god of sickness are strange and very demanding.
