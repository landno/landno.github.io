only time there is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so today, this instant, now, we come to look upon what is forever there; not in our sight, but in the eyes of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He looks past time, and sees eternity as represented there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He hears the sounds the senseless, busy world engenders, yet He hears them faintly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For beyond them all He hears the song of Heaven, and the Voice for God more clear, more meaningful, more near.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"570#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world fades easily away before His sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its sounds grow dim.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A melody from far beyond the world increasingly is more and more distinct; an ancient call to which He gives an ancient answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will recognize them both, for they are but your answer to your Father‚Äôs Call to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Christ answers for you, echoing your Self, using your voice to give His glad consent; accepting your deliverance for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"570#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How holy is your practicing today, as Christ gives you His sight and hears for you, and answers in your name the Call He hears!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How quiet is the time you give to spend with Him, beyond the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How easily are all your seeming sins forgot, and all your sorrows unremembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>On this day is grief laid by, for sights and sounds that come from nearer than the world are clear to you who will today accept the gifts He gives.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"570#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a silence into which the world can not intrude.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is an ancient peace you carry in your heart and have not lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is a sense of holiness in you the thought of sin has never touched.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All this today you will remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Faithfulness in practicing today will bring rewards so great and so completely different from all things you sought before, that you will know that here your treasure is, and here your rest.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"570#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the day when vain imaginings part like a curtain, to reveal what lies beyond them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now is what is really there made visible, while all the shadows which appeared to hide it merely sink away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Now is the balance righted, and the scale of judgment left to Him Who judges true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And in His judgment will a world unfold in perfect innocence before your eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now will you see it with the eyes of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Now is its transformation clear to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"570#6\"><p

data-sentence-id=\"570#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your vision, given you from far beyond all things within the world, looks back on them in a new light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what you see becomes the healing and salvation of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The valuable and valueless are both perceived and recognized for what they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what is worthy of your love receives your love, while nothing to be feared remains.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"570#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#7:1\"><span class=\"snr

data-sentence-id=\"570#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Our practicing today becomes our gift of thankfulness for our release from blindness and from misery.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All that we see will but increase our joy, because its holiness reflects our own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We stand forgiven in the sight of Christ, with all the world forgiven in our own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We bless the world, as we behold it in the light in which our Savior looks on us, and offer it the freedom given us through His forgiving vision, not our own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"570#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Open the curtain in your practicing by merely letting go all things you think you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your trifling treasures put away, and leave a clean and open space within your mind where Christ can come, and offer you the treasure of salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has need of your most holy mind to save the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is not this purpose worthy to be yours?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is not Christ‚Äôs vision worthy to be sought above the world‚Äôs unsatisfying goals?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"570#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let not today slip by without the gifts it holds for you receiving your consent and your acceptance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We can change the world, if you acknowledge them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You may not see the value your acceptance gives the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But this you surely want; you can exchange all suffering for joy this very day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Practice in earnest, and the gift is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Would God deceive you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Can His promise fail?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"570#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can you withhold so little, when His Hand holds out complete salvation to His Son?</span></p></div>
