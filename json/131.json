data-sentence-id=\"131#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Egos are critical in terms of the kind of “sense” they stand for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They understand this kind of sense, because it is sensible to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To the Holy Spirit it makes no sense at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"131#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To the ego it is kind and right and good to point out errors and “correct” them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This makes perfect sense to the ego, which is unaware of what errors are and what correction is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Errors are of the ego, and correction of errors lies in the relinquishment of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you correct a brother, you are telling him that he is wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He may be making no sense at the time, and it is certain that, if he is speaking from the ego, he will not be making sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But your task is still to tell him he is right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You do not tell him this verbally, if he is speaking foolishly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He needs correction at another level, because his error is at another level.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He is still right, because he is a Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>His ego is always wrong, no matter what it says or does.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"131#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you point out the errors of your brother’s ego you must be seeing through yours, because the Holy Spirit does not perceive his errors.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This <i>must</i> be true, since there is no communication between the ego and the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego makes no sense, and the Holy Spirit does not attempt to understand anything that arises from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Since He does not understand it, He does not judge it, knowing that nothing the ego makes means anything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"131#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you react at all to errors, you are not listening to the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He has merely disregarded them, and if you attend to them you are not hearing Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you do not hear Him, you are listening to your ego and making as little sense as the brother whose errors you perceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This cannot be correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it is more than merely a lack of correction for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is the giving up of correction in yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"131#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When a brother behaves insanely, you can heal him only by perceiving the sanity in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you perceive his errors and accept them, you are accepting yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you want to give yours over to the Holy Spirit, you must do this with his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Unless this becomes the one way in which you handle all errors, you cannot understand how all errors are undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How is this different from telling you that what you teach you learn?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your brother is as right as you are, and if you think he is wrong you are condemning yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"131#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span><i>You</i> cannot correct yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is it possible, then, for you to correct another?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you can see him truly, because it is possible for you to see yourself truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not up to you to change your brother, but merely to accept him as he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His errors do not come from the truth that is in him, and only this truth is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His errors cannot change this, and can have no effect at all on the truth in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To perceive errors in anyone, and to react to them as if they were real, is to make them real to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You will not escape paying the price for this, not because you are being punished for it, but because you are following the wrong guide and will therefore lose your way.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"131#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your brother’s errors are not of him, any more than yours are of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Accept his errors as real, and you have attacked yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you would find your way and keep it, see only truth beside you for you walk together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit in you forgives all things in you and in your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His errors are forgiven with yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Atonement is no more separate than love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Atonement cannot be separate because it comes from love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Any attempt you make to correct a brother means that you believe correction by you is possible, and this can only be the arrogance of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Correction is of God, Who does not know of arrogance.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"131#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit forgives everything because God created everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not undertake His function, or you will forget yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Accept only the function of healing in time, because that is what time is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God gave you the function to create in eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not need to learn that, but you do need to learn to want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For that all learning was made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the Holy Spirit’s use of an ability that you do not need, but that you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Give it to Him!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You do not understand how to use it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He will teach you how to see yourself without condemnation, by learning how to look on everything without it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"131#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Condemnation will then not be real to you, and all your errors will be forgiven.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The alertness of the
