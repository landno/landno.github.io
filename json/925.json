Others","inlineNumber":"III."},"annotation":"S-1.III","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text song-1-sect-3\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"925#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We said that prayer is always for yourself, and this is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Why, then, should you pray for others at all?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And if you should, how should you do it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Praying for others, if rightly understood, becomes a means for lifting your projections of guilt from your brother, and enabling you to recognize it is not he who is hurting you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The poisonous thought that he <i>is</i> your enemy, your evil counterpart, your nemesis, must be relinquished before <i>you</i> can be saved from guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For this the means is prayer, of rising power and with ascending goals, until it reaches even up to God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"925#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The earlier forms of prayer, at the bottom of the ladder, will not be free from envy and malice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They call for vengeance, not for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor do they come from one who understands that they are calls for death, made out of fear by those who cherish guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They call upon a vengeful god, and it is he who seems to answer them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Hell cannot be asked for another, and then escaped by him who asks for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only those who are in hell can ask for hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Those who have been forgiven, and who accepted their forgiveness, could never make a prayer like that.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"925#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>At these levels, then, the learning goal must be to recognize that prayer will bring an answer only in the form in which the prayer was made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is enough.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>From here it will be an easy step to the next levels.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The next ascent begins with this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"925#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What I have asked for for my brother is not what I would have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thus have I made of him my enemy.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"925#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is apparent that this step cannot be reached by anyone who sees no value or advantage to himself in setting others free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This may be long delayed, because it may seem to be dangerous instead of merciful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To the guilty there seems indeed to be a real advantage in having enemies, and this imagined gain must go, if enemies are to be set free.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"925#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Guilt must be given up, and not concealed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor can this be done without some pain, and a glimpse of the merciful nature of this step may for some time be followed by a deep retreat into fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For fear’s defenses are fearful in themselves, and when they are recognized they bring their fear with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet what advantage has an illusion of escape ever brought a prisoner?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His real escape from guilt can lie only in the recognition that the guilt has gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And how can this be recognized as long as he hides it in another, and does not see it as his own?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Fear of escape makes it difficult to welcome freedom, and to make a jailer of an enemy seems to be safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How, then, can he be released without an insane fear for yourself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You have made of him your salvation and your escape from guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Your investment in this escape is heavy, and your fear of letting it go is strong.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"925#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Stand still an instant, now, and think what you have done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not forget that it is you who did it, and who can therefore let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Hold out your hand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This enemy has come to bless you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Take his blessing, and feel how your heart is lifted and your fear released.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not hold on to it, nor onto him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He is a Son of God, along with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is no jailer, but a messenger of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Be this to him, that you may see him thus.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"925#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is not easy to realize that prayers for things, for status, for human love, for external “gifts” of any kind, are always made to set up jailers and to hide from guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These things are used for goals that substitute for God, and therefore distort the purpose of prayer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The desire for them <i>is</i> the prayer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>One need not ask explicitly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The goal of God is lost in the quest for lesser goals of any kind, and prayer becomes requests for enemies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The power of prayer can be quite clearly recognized even in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one who wants an enemy will fail to find one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But just as surely will he lose the only true goal that is given him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Think of the cost, and understand it well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"925#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>All other goals are at the cost of God.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"We said that prayer is always for yourself, and this is so.
