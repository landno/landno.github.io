data-sentence-id=\"103#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When your body and your ego and your dreams are gone, you will know that you will last forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you think this is accomplished through death, but nothing is accomplished through death, because death is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Everything is accomplished through life, and life is of the mind and in the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The body neither lives nor dies, because it cannot contain you who are life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If we share the same mind, you can overcome death because I did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Death is an attempt to resolve conflict by not deciding at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Like any other impossible solution the ego attempts, <i>it will not work.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"103#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God did not make the body, because it is destructible, and therefore not of the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The body is the symbol of what you think you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is clearly a separation device, and therefore does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit, as always, takes what you have made and translates it into a learning device.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Again as always, He reinterprets what the ego uses as an argument for separation into a demonstration against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If the mind can heal the body, but the body cannot heal the mind, then the mind must be stronger than the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Every miracle demonstrates this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"103#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have said that the Holy Spirit is the motivation for miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He always tells you that only the mind is real, because only the mind can be shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body is separate, and therefore cannot be part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To be of one mind is meaningful, but to be one body is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>By the laws of mind, then, the body is meaningless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"103#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To the Holy Spirit, there is no order of difficulty in miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is familiar enough to you by now, but it has not yet become believable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, you do not understand it and cannot use it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We have too much to accomplish on behalf of the Kingdom to let this crucial concept slip away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is a real foundation stone of the thought system I teach and want you to teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot perform miracles without believing it, because it is a belief in perfect equality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only one equal gift can be offered to the equal Sons of God, and that is full appreciation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nothing more and nothing less.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Without a range, order of difficulty is meaningless, and there must be no range in what you offer to your brother.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"103#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit, Who leads to God, translates communication into being, just as He ultimately translates perception into knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not lose what you communicate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego uses the body for attack, for pleasure and for pride.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The insanity of this perception makes it a fearful one indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit sees the body only as a means of communication, and because communicating is sharing it becomes communion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perhaps you think that fear as well as love can be communicated; and therefore can be shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet this is not so real as it may appear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Those who communicate fear are promoting attack, and attack always breaks communication, making it impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Egos do join together in temporary allegiance, but always for what each one can get <i>separately.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The Holy Spirit communicates only what each one can give to all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>He never takes anything back, because He wants you to keep it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Therefore, His teaching begins with the lesson:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"103#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>To have, give all to all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"103#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is a very preliminary step, and the only one you must take for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not even necessary that you complete the step yourself, but it is necessary that you turn in that direction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Having chosen to go that way, you place yourself in charge of the journey, where you and only you must remain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This step may appear to exacerbate conflict rather than resolve it, because it is the beginning step in reversing your perception and turning it right-side up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This conflicts with the upside-down perception you have not yet abandoned, or the change in direction would not have been necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Some remain at this step for a long time, experiencing very acute conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>At this point they may try to accept the conflict, rather than take the next step towards its resolution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Having taken the first step, however, they will be helped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"103#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Once they have chosen what they cannot complete alone, they are no longer alone.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"When your body and your ego and your dreams are gone, you will know that you will last forever.
