data-sentence-id=\"348#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You see the flesh or recognize the spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no compromise between the two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If one is real the other must be false, for what is real denies its opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no choice in vision but this one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you decide in this determines all you see and think is real and hold as true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>On this one choice does all your world depend, for here have you established what you are, as flesh or spirit in your own belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you choose flesh, you never will escape the body as your own reality, for you have chosen that you want it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But choose the spirit, and all Heaven bends to touch your eyes and bless your holy sight, that you may see the world of flesh no more except to heal and comfort and to bless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"348#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation is undoing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you choose to see the body, you behold a world of separation, unrelated things, and happenings that make no sense at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This one appears and disappears in death; that one is doomed to suffering and loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And no one is exactly as he was an instant previous, nor will he be the same as he is now an instant hence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who could have trust where so much change is seen, for who is worthy if he be but dust?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Salvation is undoing of all this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For constancy arises in the sight of those whose eyes salvation has released from looking at the cost of keeping guilt, because they chose to let it go instead.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"348#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation does not ask that you behold the spirit and perceive the body not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It merely asks that this should be your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For you can see the body without help, but do not understand how to behold a world apart from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is your world salvation will undo, and let you see another world your eyes could never find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be not concerned how this could ever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not understand how what you see arose to meet your sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For if you did, it would be gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The veil of ignorance is drawn across the evil and the good, and must be passed that both may disappear, so that perception finds no hiding place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>How is this done?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is not done at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>What could there be within the universe that God created that must still be done?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"348#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only in arrogance could you conceive that you must make the way to Heaven plain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The means are given you by which to see the world that will replace the one you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your will be done!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In Heaven as on earth this is forever true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It matters not where you believe you are, nor what you think the truth about yourself must really be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It makes no difference what you look upon, nor what you choose to feel or think or wish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For God Himself has said, “Your will be done.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And it is done to you accordingly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"348#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who believe that you can choose to see the Son of God as you would have him be, forget not that no concept of yourself will stand against the truth of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Undoing truth would be impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But concepts are not difficult to change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>One vision, clearly seen, that does not fit the picture as it was perceived before will change the world for eyes that learn to see, because the concept of the self has changed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"348#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Are you invulnerable?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Then the world is harmless in your sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do you forgive?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then is the world forgiving, for you have forgiven it its trespasses, and so it looks on you with eyes that see as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Are you a body?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>So is all the world perceived as treacherous, and out to kill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Are you a spirit, deathless, and without the promise of corruption and the stain of sin upon you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>So the world is seen as stable, fully worthy of your trust; a happy place to rest in for a while, where nothing need be feared, but only loved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Who is unwelcome to the kind in heart?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And what could hurt the truly innocent?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"348#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your will be done, you holy child of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not matter if you think you are in earth or Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What your Father wills of you can never change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The truth in you remains as radiant as a star, as pure as light, as innocent as love itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"348#7:5\"><span
