data-sentence-id=\"557#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can judge on partial evidence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is not judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is merely an opinion based on ignorance and doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its seeming certainty is but a cloak for the uncertainty it would conceal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It needs irrational defense because it is irrational.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And its defense seems strong, convincing, and without a doubt because of all the doubting underneath.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not seem to doubt the world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not really question what is shown you through the body’s eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor do you ask why you believe it, even though you learned a long while since your senses do deceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That you believe them to the last detail which they report is even stranger, when you pause to recollect how frequently they have been faulty witnesses indeed!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Why would you trust them so implicitly?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Why but because of underlying doubt, which you would hide with show of certainty?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can you judge?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your judgment rests upon the witness that your senses offer you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet witness never falser was than this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But how else do you judge the world you see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You place pathetic faith in what your eyes and ears report.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You think your fingers touch reality, and close upon the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is awareness that you understand, and think more real than what is witnessed to by the eternal Voice for God Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Can this be judgment?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have often been urged to refrain from judging, not because it is a right to be withheld from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot judge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You merely can believe the ego’s judgments, all of which are false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It guides your senses carefully, to prove how weak you are; how helpless and afraid, how apprehensive of just punishment, how black with sin, how wretched in your guilt.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This thing it speaks of, and would yet defend, it tells you is yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you believe that this is so with stubborn certainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet underneath remains the hidden doubt that what it shows you as reality with such conviction it does not believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is itself alone that it condemns.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is within itself it sees the guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is its own despair it sees in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Hear not its voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The witnesses it sends to prove to you its evil is your own are false, and speak with certainty of what they do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your faith in them is blind because you would not share the doubts their lord can not completely vanquish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You believe to doubt his vassals is to doubt yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet you must learn to doubt their evidence will clear the way to recognize yourself, and let the Voice for God alone be Judge of what is worthy of your own belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He will not tell you that your brother should be judged by what your eyes behold in him, nor what his body’s mouth says to your ears, nor what your fingers’ touch reports of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He passes by such idle witnesses, which merely bear false witness to God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He recognizes only what God loves, and in the holy light of what He sees do all the ego’s dreams of what you are vanish before the splendor He beholds.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let Him be Judge of what you are, for He has certainty in which there is no doubt, because it rests on Certainty so great that doubt is meaningless before Its face.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Christ cannot doubt Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Voice for God can only honor Him, rejoicing in His perfect, everlasting sinlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whom He has judged can only laugh at guilt, unwilling now to play with toys of sin; unheeding of the body’s witnesses before the rapture of Christ’s holy face.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And thus He judges you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Accept His Word for what you are, for He bears witness to your beautiful creation, and the Mind Whose Thought created your reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What can the body mean to Him Who knows the glory of the Father and the Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What whispers of the ego can He hear?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What could convince Him that your sins are real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let Him be Judge as well of everything that seems to happen to you in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His lessons will enable you to bridge the gap between illusions and the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He will remove all faith that you have placed in pain, disaster, suffering and loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He gives you vision which can look beyond these grim appearances, and can behold the gentle face of Christ in all of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will no longer doubt that only good can come to you who are beloved of God, for He will judge all happenings, and teach the single lesson that they all contain.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He will select the elements in them which represent the truth, and disregard those aspects which reflect but idle dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And He will reinterpret all you see, and all occurrences, each circumstance, and every happening that seems to touch on you in any way from His one frame of reference, wholly unified and sure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you will see the love beyond the hate, the constancy in change, the pure in sin, and only Heaven’s blessing on the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is your resurrection, for your life is not a part of anything you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It stands beyond the body and the world, past every witness for unholiness, within the Holy, holy as Itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In everyone and everything His Voice would speak to you of nothing but your Self and your Creator, Who is one with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>So will you see the holy face of Christ in everything, and hear in everything no sound except the echo of God’s Voice.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We practice wordlessly today, except at the beginning of the time we spend with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We introduce these times with but a single, slow repeating of the thought with which the day begins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And then we watch our thoughts, appealing silently to Him Who sees the elements of truth in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let Him evaluate each thought that comes to mind, remove the elements of dreams, and give them back again as clean ideas that do not contradict the Will of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Give Him your thoughts, and He will give them back as miracles which joyously proclaim the wholeness and the happiness God wills His Son, as proof of His eternal Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And as each thought is thus transformed, it takes on healing power from the Mind which saw the truth in it, and failed to be deceived by what was falsely added.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All the threads of fantasy are gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what remains is unified into a perfect Thought that offers its perfection everywhere.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Spend fifteen minutes thus when you awake, and gladly give another fifteen more before you go to sleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your ministry begins as all your thoughts are purified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>So are you taught to teach the Son of God the holy lesson of his sanctity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one can fail to listen, when you hear the Voice for God give honor to God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And everyone will share the thoughts with you which He has retranslated in your mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is your Eastertide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so you lay the gift of snow-white lilies on the world, replacing witnesses to sin and death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Through your transfiguration is the world redeemed, and joyfully released from guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now do we lift our resurrected minds in gladness and in gratitude to Him Who has restored our sanity to us.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"557#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And we will hourly remember Him Who is salvation and deliverance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As we give thanks, the world unites with us and happily accepts our holy thoughts, which Heaven has corrected and made pure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Now has our ministry begun at last, to carry round the world the joyous news that truth has no illusions, and the peace of God, through us, belongs to everyone.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"No one can judge on partial evidence.
