data-sentence-id=\"822#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This question really answers itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Healing cannot be repeated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If the patient is healed, what remains to heal him from?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if the healing is certain, as we have already said it is, what is there to repeat?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For a teacher of God to remain concerned about the result of healing is to limit the healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is now the teacher of God himself whose mind needs to be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it is this he must facilitate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is now the patient, and he must so regard himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He has made a mistake, and must be willing to change his mind about it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He lacked the trust that makes for giving truly, and so he has not received the benefit of his gift.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"822#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever a teacher of God has tried to be a channel for healing he has succeeded.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Should he be tempted to doubt this, he should not repeat his previous effort.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That was already maximal, because the Holy Spirit so accepted it and so used it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now the teacher of God has only one course to follow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He must use his reason to tell himself that he has given the problem to One Who cannot fail, and must recognize that his own uncertainty is not love but fear, and therefore hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His position has thus become untenable, for he is offering hate to one to whom he offered love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Having offered love, only love can be received.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"822#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is in this that the teacher of God must trust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is what is really meant by the statement that the one responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The teacher of God is a miracle worker because he gives the gifts he has received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet he must first accept them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He need do no more, nor is there more that he could do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>By accepting healing he can give it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If he doubts this, let him remember Who gave the gift and Who received it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Thus is his doubt corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He thought the gifts of God could be withdrawn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>That was a mistake, but hardly one to stay with.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And so the teacher of God can only recognize it for what it is, and let it be corrected for him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"822#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>One of the most difficult temptations to recognize is that to doubt a healing because of the appearance of continuing symptoms is a mistake in the form of lack of trust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As such it is an attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Usually it seems to be just the opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does appear unreasonable at first to be told that continued concern is attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It has all the appearances of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet love without trust is impossible, and doubt and trust cannot coexist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And hate must be the opposite of love, regardless of the form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Doubt not the gift and it is impossible to doubt its result.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is the certainty that gives God’s teachers the power to be miracle workers, for they have put their trust in Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"822#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The real basis for doubt about the outcome of any problem that has been given to God’s Teacher for resolution is always self-doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And that necessarily implies that trust has been placed in an illusory self, for only such a self can be doubted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This illusion can take many forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perhaps there is a fear of weakness and vulnerability.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perhaps there is a fear of failure and shame associated with a sense of inadequacy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perhaps there is a guilty embarrassment stemming from false humility.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The form of the mistake is not important.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What is important is only the recognition of a mistake as a mistake.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"822#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The mistake is always some form of concern with the self to the exclusion of the patient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a failure to recognize him as part of the Self, and thus represents a confusion in identity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Conflict about what you are has entered your mind, and you have become deceived about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you are deceived about yourself because you have denied the Source of your creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you are offering only healing, you cannot doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you really want the problem solved, you cannot doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you are certain what the problem is, you cannot doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Doubt is the result of conflicting wishes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"822#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Be sure of what you want, and doubt becomes impossible.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"This question really answers itself.
