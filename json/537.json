data-sentence-id=\"537#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What keeps the world in chains but your beliefs?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what can save the world except your Self?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Belief is powerful indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The thoughts you hold are mighty, and illusions are as strong in their effects as is the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A madman thinks the world he sees is real, and does not doubt it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nor can he be swayed by questioning his thoughts’ effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is but when their source is raised to question that the hope of freedom comes to him at last.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet is salvation easily achieved, for anyone is free to change his mind, and all his thoughts change with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now the source of thought has shifted, for to change your mind means you have changed the source of all ideas you think or ever thought or yet will think.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You free the past from what you thought before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You free the future from all ancient thoughts of seeking what you do not want to find.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The present now remains the only time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here in the present is the world set free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For as you let the past be lifted and release the future from your ancient fears, you find escape and give it to the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have enslaved the world with all your fears, your doubts and miseries, your pain and tears; and all your sorrows press on it, and keep the world a prisoner to your beliefs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Death strikes it everywhere because you hold the bitter thoughts of death within your mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world is nothing in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your mind must give it meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what you behold upon it are your wishes, acted out so you can look on them and think them real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perhaps you think you did not make the world, but came unwillingly to what was made already, hardly waiting for your thoughts to give it meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet in truth you found exactly what you looked for when you came.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no world apart from what you wish, and herein lies your ultimate release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Change but your mind on what you want to see, and all the world must change accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Ideas leave not their source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This central theme is often stated in the text, and must be borne in mind if you would understand the lesson for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not pride which tells you that you made the world you see, and that it changes as you change your mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But it is pride that argues you have come into a world quite separate from yourself, impervious to what you think, and quite apart from what you chance to think it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no world!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the central thought the course attempts to teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Not everyone is ready to accept it, and each one must go as far as he can let himself be led along the road to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He will return and go still farther, or perhaps step back a while and then return again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But healing is the gift of those who are prepared to learn there is no world, and can accept the lesson now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Their readiness will bring the lesson to them in some form which they can understand and recognize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Some see it suddenly on point of death, and rise to teach it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Others find it in experience that is not of this world, which shows them that the world does not exist because what they behold must be the truth, and yet it clearly contradicts the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And some will find it in this course, and in the exercises that we do today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today’s idea is true because the world does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And if it is indeed your own imagining, then you can loose it from all things you ever thought it was by merely changing all the thoughts that gave it these appearances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The sick are healed as you let go all thoughts of sickness, and the dead arise when you let thoughts of life replace all thoughts you ever held of death.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A lesson earlier repeated once must now be stressed again, for it contains the firm foundation for today’s idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are as God created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no place where you can suffer, and no time that can bring change to your eternal state.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How can a world of time and place exist, if you remain as God created you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is the lesson for today except another way of saying that to know your Self is the salvation of the world?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To free the world from every kind of pain is but to change your mind about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no world apart from your ideas because ideas leave not their source, and you maintain the world within your mind in thought.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet if you are as God created you, you cannot think apart from Him, nor make what does not share His timelessness and Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Are these inherent in the world you see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Does it create like Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Unless it does, it is not real, and cannot be at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you are real the world you see is false, for God’s creation is unlike the world in every way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And as it was His Thought by which you were created, so it is your thoughts which made it and must set it free, that you may know the Thoughts you share with God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Release the world!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your real creations wait for this release to give you fatherhood, not of illusions, but as God in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God shares His Fatherhood with you who are His Son, for He makes no distinctions in what is Himself and what is still Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What He creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no world because it is a thought apart from God, and made to separate the Father and the Son, and break away a part of God Himself and thus destroy His Wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can a world which comes from this idea be real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Can it be anywhere?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Deny illusions, but accept the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Deny you are a shadow briefly laid upon a dying world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Release your mind, and you will look upon a world released.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today our purpose is to free the world from all the idle thoughts we ever held about it, and about all living things we see upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They can not be there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No more can we.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For we are in the home our Father set for us, along with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And we who are as He created us would loose the world this day from every one of our illusions, that we may be free.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin the fifteen-minute periods in which we practice twice today with this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"537#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I who remain as God created me would loose the world from all I thought it was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For I am real because the world is not, and I would know my own reality.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"537#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then merely rest, alert but with no strain, and let your mind in quietness be changed so that the world is freed, along with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You need not realize that healing comes to many brothers far across the world, as well as to the ones you see nearby, as you send out these thoughts to bless the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But you will sense your own release, although you may not fully understand as yet that you could never be released alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"537#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Throughout the day, increase the freedom sent through your ideas to all the world, and say whenever you are tempted to deny the power of your simple change of mind:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"537#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I loose the world from all I thought it was, and choose my own reality instead.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"What keeps the world in chains but your beliefs?
