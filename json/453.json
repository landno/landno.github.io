class=\"snr\">2</span>Thereafter, it is not necessary to follow any particular order in considering them, though each one should be practiced at least once.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Devote two minutes or more to each practice period, thinking about the idea and the related comments after reading them over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do this as often as possible during the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If any one of the five ideas appeals to you more than the others, concentrate on that one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>At the end of the day, however, be sure to review all of them once more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"453#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is not necessary to cover the comments that follow each idea either literally or thoroughly in the practice periods.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try, rather, to emphasize the central point, and think about it as part of your review of the idea to which it relates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>After you have read the idea and the related comments, the exercises should be done with your eyes closed and when you are alone in a quiet place, if possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"453#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"453#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It will be necessary, however, that you learn to require no special settings in which to apply what you have learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will need your learning most in situations that appear to be upsetting, rather than in those that already seem to be calm and quiet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The purpose of your learning is to enable you to bring the quiet with you, and to heal distress and turmoil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is not done by avoiding them and seeking a haven of isolation for yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"453#5\"><p

there to embrace any situation in which you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And finally you will learn that there is no limit to where you are, so that your peace is everywhere, as you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"453#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#6:1\"><span class=\"snr

as they are given here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not necessary to return to the original statements, nor to apply the ideas as was suggested then.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"453#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We are now emphasizing the relationships among the first fifty of the ideas we have covered, and the cohesiveness of the thought system to which they are leading you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Beginning with today we will have a series of review periods.
