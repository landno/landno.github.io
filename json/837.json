data-sentence-id=\"837#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing and Atonement are not related; they are identical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no order of difficulty in miracles because there are no degrees of Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the one complete concept possible in this world, because it is the source of a wholly unified perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Partial Atonement is a meaningless idea, just as special areas of hell in Heaven are inconceivable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Accept Atonement and you are healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Atonement is the Word of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Accept His Word and what remains to make sickness possible?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Accept His Word and every miracle has been accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To forgive is to heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The teacher of God has taken accepting the Atonement for himself as his only function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>What is there, then, he cannot heal?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>What miracle can be withheld from him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"837#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The progress of the teacher of God may be slow or rapid, depending on whether he recognizes the Atonement’s inclusiveness, or for a time excludes some problem areas from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In some cases, there is a sudden and complete awareness of the perfect applicability of the lesson of the Atonement to all situations, but this is comparatively rare.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The teacher of God may have accepted the function God has given him long before he has learned all that his acceptance holds out to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is only the end that is certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Anywhere along the way, the necessary realization of inclusiveness may reach him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If the way seems long, let him be content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He has decided on the direction he wants to take.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What more was asked of him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And having done what was required, would God withhold the rest?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"837#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That forgiveness is healing needs to be understood, if the teacher of God is to make progress.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The idea that a body can be sick is a central concept in the ego’s thought system.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This thought gives the body autonomy, separates it from the mind, and keeps the idea of attack inviolate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If the body could be sick Atonement would be impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A body that can order a mind to do as it sees fit could merely take the place of God and prove salvation is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What, then, is left to heal?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The body has become lord of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How could the mind be returned to the Holy Spirit unless the body is killed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And who would want salvation at such a price?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"837#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Certainly sickness does not appear to be a decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor would anyone actually believe he wants to be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Perhaps he can accept the idea in theory, but it is rarely if ever consistently applied to all specific forms of sickness, both in the individual’s perception of himself and of all others as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor is it at this level that the teacher of God calls forth the miracle of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He overlooks the mind <i>and</i> body, seeing only the face of Christ shining in front of him, correcting all mistakes and healing all perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Healing is the result of the recognition, by God’s teacher, of who it is that is in need of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This recognition has no special reference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is true of all things that God created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>In it are all illusions healed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"837#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When a teacher of God fails to heal, it is because he has forgotten Who he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Another’s sickness thus becomes his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In allowing this to happen, he has identified with another’s ego, and has thus confused him with a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In so doing, he has refused to accept the Atonement for himself, and can hardly offer it to his brother in Christ’s Name.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He will, in fact, be unable to recognize his brother at all, for his Father did not create bodies, and so he is seeing in his brother only the unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Mistakes do not correct mistakes, and distorted perception does not heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Step back now, teacher of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You have been wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Lead not the way, for you have lost it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Turn quickly to your Teacher, and let yourself be healed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"837#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The offer of Atonement is universal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is equally applicable to all individuals in all circumstances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And in it is the power to heal all individuals of all forms of sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Not to believe this is to be unfair to God, and thus unfaithful to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A sick person perceives himself as separate from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Would you see him as separate from you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is your task to heal the sense of separation that has made him sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is your function to recognize for him that what he believes about himself is not the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is your forgiveness that must show him this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Healing is very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Atonement is received and offered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Having been received, it must be accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>It is in the receiving, then, that healing lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#6:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>All else must follow from this single purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"837#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who can limit the power of God Himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who, then, can say which one can be healed of what, and what must remain beyond God’s power to forgive?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is insanity indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not up to God’s teachers to set limits upon Him, because it is not up to them to judge His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And to judge His Son is to limit his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Both are equally meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet this will not be understood until God’s teacher recognizes that they are the same mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Herein does he receive Atonement, for he withdraws his judgment from the Son of God, accepting him as God created him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>No longer does he stand apart from God, determining where healing should be given and where it should be withheld.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"837#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Now can he say with God, “This is my beloved Son, created perfect and forever so.”</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Healing and
