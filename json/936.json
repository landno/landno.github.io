a quiet choice, made joyfully and with a sense of peace, because the body has been kindly used to help the Son of God along the way he goes to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"936#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We thank the body, then, for all the service it has given us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"936#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But we are thankful, too, the need is done to walk the world of limits, and to reach the Christ in hidden forms and clearly seen at most in lovely flashes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"936#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now we can behold Him without blinders, in the light that we have learned to look upon again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"936#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"936#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We call it death, but it is liberty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"936#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not come in forms that seem to be thrust down in pain upon unwilling flesh, but as a gentle welcome to release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"936#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If there has been true healing, this can be the form in which death comes when it is time to rest a while from labor gladly done and gladly ended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"936#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now we go in peace to freer air and gentler climate, where it is not hard to see the gifts we gave were saved for us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"936#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For Christ is clearer now;
