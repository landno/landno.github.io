data-sentence-id=\"076#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have already discussed the Last Judgment, but in insufficient detail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>After the Last Judgment there will be no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Judgment is symbolic because beyond perception there is no judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When the Bible says “Judge not that ye be not judged,” it means that if you judge the reality of others you will be unable to avoid judging your own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The choice to judge rather than to know is the cause of the loss of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Judgment is the process on which perception but not knowledge rests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have discussed this before in terms of the selectivity of perception, pointing out that evaluation is its obvious prerequisite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Judgment always involves rejection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It never emphasizes only the positive aspects of what is judged, whether in you or in others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What has been perceived and rejected, or judged and found wanting, remains in your mind because it has been perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>One of the illusions from which you suffer is the belief that what you judged against has no effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This cannot be true unless you also believe that what you judged against does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You evidently do not believe this, or you would not have judged against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>In the end it does not matter whether your judgment is right or wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Either way you are placing your belief in the unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>This cannot be avoided in any type of judgment, because it implies the belief that reality is yours to select <i>from.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have no idea of the tremendous release and deep peace that comes from meeting yourself and your brothers totally without judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you recognize what you are and what your brothers are, you will realize that judging them in any way is without meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In fact, their meaning is lost to you precisely <i>because</i> you are judging them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All uncertainty comes from the belief that you are under the coercion of judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not need judgment to organize your life, and you certainly do not need it to organize yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In the presence of knowledge all judgment is automatically suspended, and this is the process that enables recognition to replace perception.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are very fearful of everything you have perceived but have refused to accept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You believe that, because you have refused to accept it, you have lost control over it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is why you see it in nightmares, or in pleasant disguises in what seem to be your happier dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing that you have refused to accept can be brought into awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not dangerous in itself, but you have made it seem dangerous to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you feel tired, it is because you have judged yourself as capable of being tired.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you laugh at someone, it is because you have judged him as unworthy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you laugh at yourself you must laugh at others, if only because you cannot tolerate the idea of being more unworthy than they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All this makes you feel tired because it is essentially disheartening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are not really capable of being tired, but you are very capable of wearying yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The strain of constant judgment is virtually intolerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is curious that an ability so debilitating would be so deeply cherished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet if you wish to be the author of reality, you will insist on holding on to judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You will also regard judgment with fear, believing that it will someday be used against you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This belief can exist only to the extent that you believe in the efficacy of judgment as a weapon of defense for your own authority.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God offers only mercy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your words should reflect only mercy, because that is what you have received and that is what you should give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Justice is a temporary expedient, or an attempt to teach you the meaning of mercy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is judgmental only because you are capable of injustice.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have spoken of different symptoms, and at that level there is almost endless variation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is, however, only one cause for all of them: the authority problem.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This <i>is</i> “the root of all evil.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Every symptom the ego makes involves a contradiction in terms, because the mind is split between the ego and the Holy Spirit, so that whatever the ego makes is incomplete and contradictory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This untenable position is the result of the authority problem which, because it accepts the one inconceivable thought as its premise, can produce only ideas that are inconceivable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The issue of authority is really a question of authorship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you have an authority problem, it is always because you believe you are the author of yourself and project your delusion onto others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You then perceive the situation as one in which others are literally fighting you for your authorship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the fundamental error of all those who believe they have usurped the power of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This belief is very frightening to them, but hardly troubles God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is, however, eager to undo it, not to punish His children, but only because He knows that it makes them unhappy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God’s creations are given their true Authorship, but you prefer to be anonymous when you choose to separate yourself from your Author.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Being uncertain of your true Authorship, you believe that your creation was anonymous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This leaves you in a position where it sounds meaningful to believe that you created yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The dispute over authorship has left such uncertainty in your mind that it may even doubt whether you really exist at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only those who give over all desire to reject can know that their own rejection is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have not usurped the power of God, but you <i>have</i> lost it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fortunately, to lose something does not mean that it has gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It merely means that you do not remember where it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its existence does not depend on your ability to identify it, or even to place it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is possible to look on reality without judgment and merely know that it is there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Peace is a natural heritage of spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Everyone is free to refuse to accept his inheritance, but he is not free to establish what his inheritance is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The problem everyone must decide is the fundamental question of authorship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All fear comes ultimately, and sometimes by way of very devious routes, from the denial of Authorship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The offense is never to God, but only to those who deny Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To deny His Authorship is to deny yourself the reason for your peace, so that you see yourself only in segments.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This strange perception <i>is</i> the authority problem.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"076#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no one who does not feel that he is imprisoned in some way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If this is the result of his own free will he must regard his will as not free, or the circular reasoning in this position would be quite apparent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Free will must lead to freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Judgment always imprisons because it separates segments of reality by the unstable scales of desire.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Wishes are not facts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To wish is to imply that willing is not sufficient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet no one in his right mind believes that what is wished is as real as what is willed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"076#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Instead of “Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven” say, “<i>Will</i> ye first the Kingdom of Heaven,” and you have said, “I know what I am and I accept my own inheritance.”</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"We have
