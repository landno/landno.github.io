Payment","inlineNumber":"III."},"annotation":"P-3.III","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text psycho-3-sect-3\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"915#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can pay for therapy, for healing is of God and He asks for nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is, however, part of His plan that everything in this world be used by the Holy Spirit to help in carrying out the plan.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Even an advanced therapist has some earthly needs while he is here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Should he need money it will be given him, not in payment, but to help him better serve the plan.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Money is not evil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But no one here can live with no illusions, for he must yet strive to have the last illusion be accepted by everyone everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He has a mighty part in this one purpose, for which he came.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He stays here but for this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And while he stays he will be given what he needs to stay.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"915#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only an unhealed healer would try to heal for money, and he will not succeed to the extent to which he values it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor will he find his healing in the process.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There will be those of whom the Holy Spirit asks some payment for His purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There will be those from whom He does not ask.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It should not be the therapist who makes these decisions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is a difference between payment and cost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To give money where God’s plan allots it has no cost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To withhold it from where it rightfully belongs has enormous cost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The therapist who would do this loses the name of healer, for he could never understand what healing is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He cannot give it, and so he does not have it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"915#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The therapists of this world are indeed useless to the world’s salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They make demands, and so they cannot give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Patients can pay only for the exchange of illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This, indeed, must demand payment, and the cost is great.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A “bought” relationship cannot offer the only gift whereby all healing is accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Forgiveness, the Holy Spirit’s only dream, must have no cost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For if it does, it merely crucifies God’s Son again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can this be how he is forgiven?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Can this be how the dream of sin will end?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"915#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The right to live is something no one need fight for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is promised him, and guaranteed by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore it is a right the therapist and patient share alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If their relationship is to be holy, whatever one needs is given by the other; whatever one lacks the other supplies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Herein is the relationship made holy, for herein both are healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The therapist repays the patient in gratitude, as does the patient repay him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no cost to either.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But thanks are due to both, for the release from long imprisonment and doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Who would not be grateful for such a gift?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet who could possibly imagine that it could be bought?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"915#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It has well been said that to him who hath shall be given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Because he has, he can give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And because he gives, he shall be given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the law of God, and not of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>So it is with God’s healers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They give because they have heard His Word and understood it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All that they need will thus be given them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But they will lose this understanding unless they remember that all they have comes only from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If they believe they need anything from a brother, they will recognize him as a brother no longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And if they do this, a light goes out even in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Where God’s Son turns against himself, he can look only upon darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>He has himself denied the light, and cannot see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"915#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>One rule should always be observed: No one should be turned away because he cannot pay.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one is sent by accident to anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Relationships are always purposeful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whatever their purpose may have been before the Holy Spirit entered them, they are always His potential temple; the resting place of Christ and home of God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Whoever comes has been sent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perhaps he was sent to give his brother the money he needed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Both will be blessed thereby.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Perhaps he was sent to teach the therapist how much he needs forgiveness, and how valueless is money in comparison.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Again will both be blessed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Only in terms of cost could one have more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>In sharing, everyone must gain a blessing without cost.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"915#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This view of payment may well seem impractical, and in the eyes of the world it would be so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet not one worldly thought is really practical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How much is gained by striving for illusions?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How much is lost by throwing God away?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And is it possible to do so?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Surely it is impractical to strive for nothing, and to attempt to do what is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Then stop a while, long enough to think of this: You have perhaps been seeking for salvation without recognizing where to look.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Whoever asks your help can show you where.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What greater gift than this could you be given?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What greater gift is there that you would give?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"915#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Physician, healer, therapist, teacher, heal thyself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Many will come to you carrying the gift of healing, if you so elect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit never refuses an invitation to enter and abide with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He will give you endless opportunities to open the door to your salvation, for such is His function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He will also tell you exactly what your function is in every circumstance and at all times.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Whoever He sends you will reach you, holding out his hand to his Friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let the Christ in you bid him welcome, for that same Christ is in him as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Deny him entrance, and you have denied the Christ in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Remember the sorrowful story of the world, and the glad tidings of salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Remember the plan of God for the restoration of joy and peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And do not forget how very simple are the ways of God:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>You were lost in the darkness of the world until you asked for light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"915#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>And then God sent His Son to give it to you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"No one can pay for therapy, for healing is of God and He asks for nothing.
