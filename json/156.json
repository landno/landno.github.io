data-sentence-id=\"156#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Miracles are merely the translation of denial into truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If to love oneself is to heal oneself, those who are sick do not love themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, they are asking for the love that would heal them, but which they are denying to themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If they knew the truth about themselves they could not be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The task of the miracle worker thus becomes <i>to deny the denial of truth.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The sick must heal themselves, for the truth is in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet having obscured it, the light in another mind must shine into theirs because that light <i>is</i> theirs.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"156#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The light in them shines as brightly regardless of the density of the fog that obscures it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you give no power to the fog to obscure the light, it has none.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it has power only if the Son of God gives power to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He must himself withdraw that power, remembering that all power is of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can remember this for all the Sonship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not allow your brother not to remember, for his forgetfulness is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But your remembering is his, for God cannot be remembered alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span><i>This is what you have forgotten.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To perceive the healing of your brother as the healing of yourself is thus the way to remember God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For you forgot your brothers with Him, and God’s Answer to your forgetting is but the way to remember.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"156#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perceive in sickness but another call for love, and offer your brother what he believes he cannot offer himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Whatever the sickness, there is but one remedy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will be made whole as you make whole, for to perceive in sickness the appeal for health is to recognize in hatred the call for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And to give a brother what he really wants is to offer it unto yourself, for your Father wills you to know your brother as yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Answer his call for love, and yours is answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Healing is the Love of Christ for His Father and for Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"156#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember what was said about the frightening perceptions of little children, which terrify them because they do not understand them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If they ask for enlightenment and accept it, their fears vanish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But if they hide their nightmares they will keep them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is easy to help an uncertain child, for he recognizes that he does not understand what his perceptions mean.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you believe that you do understand yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Little child, you are hiding your head under the cover of the heavy blankets you have laid upon yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are hiding your nightmares in the darkness of your own false certainty, and refusing to open your eyes and look at them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"156#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us not save nightmares, for they are not fitting offerings for Christ, and so they are not fit gifts for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Take off the covers and look at what you are afraid of.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only the anticipation will frighten you, for the reality of nothingness cannot be frightening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let us not delay this, for your dream of hatred will not leave you without help, and Help is here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Learn to be quiet in the midst of turmoil, for quietness is the end of strife and this is the journey to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Look straight at every image that rises to delay you, for the goal is inevitable because it is eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The goal of love is but your right, and it belongs to you despite your dreams.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"156#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You still want what God wills, and no nightmare can defeat a child of God in his purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For your purpose was given you by God, and you must accomplish it because it is His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Awake and remember your purpose, for it is your will to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What has been accomplished for you must be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not let your hatred stand in the way of love, for nothing can withstand the Love of Christ for His Father, or His Father’s Love for Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"156#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A little while and you will see me, for I am not hidden because <i>you</i> are hiding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I will awaken you as surely as I awakened myself, for I awoke for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In my resurrection is your release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Our mission is to escape from crucifixion, not from redemption.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Trust in my help, for I did not walk alone, and I will walk with you as our Father walked with me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do you not know that I walked with Him in peace?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And does not that mean that peace goes with <i>us</i> on the journey?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"156#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no fear in perfect love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will but be making perfect to you what is already perfect in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not fear the unknown but the known.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will not fail in your mission because I did not fail in mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Give me but a little trust in the name of the complete trust I have in you, and we will easily accomplish the goal of perfection together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For perfection <i>is,</i> and cannot be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To deny the denial of perfection is not so difficult as to deny truth, and what we can accomplish together will be believed when you see it as accomplished.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"156#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who have tried to banish love have not succeeded, but you who choose to banish fear must succeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Lord is with you, but you know it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet your Redeemer liveth, and abideth in you in the peace out of which He was created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would you not exchange this awareness for the awareness of fear?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When we have overcome fear—not by hiding it, not by minimizing it, and not by denying its full import in any way—this is what you will really see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot lay aside the obstacles to real vision without looking upon them, for to lay aside means to judge against.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you will look, the Holy Spirit will judge, and He will judge truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet He cannot shine away what you keep hidden, for you have not offered it to Him and He cannot take it from you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"156#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We are therefore embarking on an organized, well-structured and carefully planned program aimed at learning how to offer to the Holy Spirit everything you do not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He knows what to do with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not understand how to use what He knows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whatever is given Him that is not of God is gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you must look at it yourself in perfect willingness, for otherwise His knowledge remains useless to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Surely He will not fail to help you, since help is His only purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"156#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do you not have greater reason for fearing the world as you perceive it, than for looking at the cause of fear and letting it go forever?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Miracles are merely the translation of denial into truth.
