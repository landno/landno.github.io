class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can look upon what your grievances conceal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Because your grievances are hiding the light of the world in you, everyone stands in darkness, and you beside him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But as the veil of your grievances is lifted, you are released with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Share your salvation now with him who stood beside you when you were in hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is your brother in the light of the world that saves you both.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"472#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today let us make another real attempt to reach the light in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Before we undertake this in our more extended practice period, let us devote several minutes to thinking about what we are trying to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We are literally attempting to get in touch with the salvation of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We are trying to see past the veil of darkness that keeps it concealed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We are trying to let the veil be lifted, and to see the tears of God‚Äôs Son disappear in the sunlight.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"472#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us begin our longer practice period today with the full realization that this is so, and with real determination to reach what is dearer to us than all else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Salvation is our only need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no other purpose here, and no other function to fulfill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Learning salvation is our only goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let us end the ancient search today by finding the light in us, and holding it up for everyone who searches with us to look upon and rejoice.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"472#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Very quietly now, with your eyes closed, try to let go of all the content that generally occupies your consciousness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Think of your mind as a vast circle, surrounded by a layer of heavy, dark clouds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can see only the clouds because you seem to be standing outside the circle and quite apart from it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"472#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>From where you stand, you can see no reason to believe there is a brilliant light hidden by the clouds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The clouds seem to be the only reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They seem to be all there is to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore, you do not attempt to go through them and past them, which is the only way in which you would be really convinced of their lack of substance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We will make this attempt today.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"472#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>After you have thought about the importance of what you are trying to do for yourself and the world, try to settle down in perfect stillness, remembering only how much you want to reach the light in you today,‚Äînow!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Determine to go past the clouds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Reach out and touch them in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Brush them aside with your hand; feel them resting on your cheeks and forehead and eyelids as you go through them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Go on; clouds cannot stop you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"472#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are doing the exercises properly, you will begin to feel a sense of being lifted up and carried ahead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your little effort and small determination call on the power of the universe to help you, and God Himself will raise you from darkness into light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are in accord with His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot fail because your will is His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"472#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Have confidence in your Father today, and be certain that He has heard you and answered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may not recognize His answer yet, but you can indeed be sure that it is given you and you will yet receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Try, as you attempt to go through the clouds to the light, to hold this confidence in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Try to remember that you are at last joining your will to God‚Äôs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Try to keep the thought clearly in mind that what you undertake with God must succeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then let the power of God work in you and through you, that His Will and yours be done.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"472#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the shorter practice periods, which you will want to do as often as possible in view of the importance of today‚Äôs idea to you and your happiness, remind yourself that your grievances are hiding the light of the world from your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Remind yourself also that you are not searching for it alone, and that you do know where to look for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Say, then:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"472#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>My grievances hide the light of the world in me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I cannot see what I have hidden.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"472#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet I want to let it be revealed to me, for my salvation and the salvation of the world.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"472#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Also, be sure to tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"472#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If I hold this grievance the light of the world will be hidden from me,</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"472#9:8\">if you are tempted to hold anything against anyone today.</span></p></div>
