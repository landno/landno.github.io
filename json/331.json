data-sentence-id=\"331#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The slave of idols is a willing slave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For willing he must be to let himself bow down in worship to what has no life, and seek for power in the powerless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What happened to the holy Son of God that this could be his wish; to let himself fall lower than the stones upon the ground, and look to idols that they raise him up?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Hear, then, your story in the dream you made, and ask yourself if it be not the truth that you believe that it is not a dream.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"331#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A dream of judgment came into the mind that God created perfect as Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And in that dream was Heaven changed to hell, and God made enemy unto His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How can God’s Son awaken from the dream?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a dream of judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>So must he judge not, and he will waken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the dream will seem to last while he is part of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Judge not, for he who judges will have need of idols, which will hold the judgment off from resting on himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nor can he know the Self he has condemned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Judge not, because you make yourself a part of evil dreams, where idols are your “true” identity, and your salvation from the judgment laid in terror and in guilt upon yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"331#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All figures in the dream are idols, made to save you from the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet they are part of what they have been made to save you <i>from.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus does an idol keep the dream alive and terrible, for who could wish for one unless he were in terror and despair?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And this the idol represents, and so its worship is the worship of despair and terror, and the dream from which they come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Judgment is an injustice to God’s Son, and it <i>is</i> justice that who judges him will not escape the penalty he laid upon himself within the dream he made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God knows of justice, not of penalty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But in the dream of judgment you attack and are condemned; and wish to be the slave of idols, which are interposed between your judgment and the penalty it brings.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"331#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There can be no salvation in the dream as you are dreaming it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For idols must be part of it, to save you from what you believe you have accomplished, and have done to make you sinful and put out the light within you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Little child, the light is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do but dream, and idols are the toys you dream you play with.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who has need of toys but children?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They pretend they rule the world, and give their toys the power to move about, and talk and think and feel and speak for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet everything their toys appear to do is in the minds of those who play with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But they are eager to forget that they made up the dream in which their toys are real, nor recognize their wishes are their own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"331#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nightmares are childish dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The toys have turned against the child who thought he made them real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet can a dream attack?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Or can a toy grow large and dangerous and fierce and wild?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This does the child believe, because he fears his thoughts and gives them to the toys instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And their reality becomes his own, because they seem to save him from his thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet do they keep his thoughts alive and real, but seen outside himself, where they can turn against him for his treachery to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He thinks he needs them that he may escape his thoughts, because he thinks the thoughts are real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And so he makes of anything a toy, to make his world remain outside himself, and play that he is but a part of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"331#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a time when childhood should be passed and gone forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Seek not to retain the toys of children.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Put them all away, for you have need of them no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The dream of judgment is a children’s game, in which the child becomes the father, powerful, but with the little wisdom of a child.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What hurts him is destroyed; what helps him, blessed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Except he judges this as does a child, who does not know what hurts and what will heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And bad things seem to happen, and he is afraid of all the chaos in a world he thinks is governed by the laws he made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet is the real world unaffected by the world he thinks is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nor have its laws been changed because he does not understand.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"331#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The real world still is but a dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Except the figures have been changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are not seen as idols which betray.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a dream in which no one is used to substitute for something else, nor interposed between the thoughts the mind conceives and what it sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one is used for something he is not, for childish things have all been put away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what was once a dream of judgment now has changed into a dream where all is joy, because that is the purpose that it has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only forgiving dreams can enter here, for time is almost over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And the forms that enter in the dream are now perceived as brothers, not in judgment, but in love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"331#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiving dreams have little need to last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are not made to separate the mind from what it thinks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They do not seek to prove the dream is being dreamed by someone else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And in these dreams a melody is heard that everyone remembers, though he has not heard it since before all time began.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forgiveness, once complete, brings timelessness so close the song of Heaven can be heard, not with the ears, but with the holiness that never left the altar that abides forever deep within the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And when he hears this song again, he knows he never heard it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And where is time, when dreams of judgment have been put away?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"331#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you feel fear in any form,—and you <i>are</i> fearful if you do not feel a deep content, a certainty of help, a calm assurance Heaven goes with you,—be sure you made an idol, and believe it will betray you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For beneath your hope that it will save you lie the guilt and pain of self-betrayal and uncertainty, so deep and bitter that the dream cannot conceal completely all your sense of doom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your self-betrayal must result in fear, for fear <i>is</i> judgment, leading surely to the frantic search for idols and for death.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"331#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiving dreams remind you that you live in safety and have not attacked yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So do your childish terrors melt away, and dreams become a sign that you have made a new beginning, not another try to worship idols and to keep attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiving dreams are kind to everyone who figures in the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so they bring the dreamer full release from dreams of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He does not fear his judgment for he has judged no one, nor has sought to be released through judgment from what judgment must impose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"331#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And all the while he is remembering what he forgot, when judgment seemed to be the way to save him from its penalty.</span></p></div>
