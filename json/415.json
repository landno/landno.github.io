class=\"snr\">5</span>On the contrary, you will be particularly likely to think you do perceive it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"415#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Recognition of meaninglessness arouses intense anxiety in all the separated ones.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It represents a situation in which God and the ego ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù each other as to whose meaning is to be written in the empty space that meaninglessness provides.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego rushes in frantically to establish its own ideas there, fearful that the void may otherwise be used to demonstrate its own impotence and unreality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And on this alone it is correct.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"415#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is essential, therefore, that you learn to recognize the meaningless, and accept it without fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you are fearful, it is certain that you will endow the world with attributes that it does not possess, and crowd it with images that do not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To the ego illusions are safety devices, as they must also be to you who equate yourself with the ego.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"415#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The exercises for today, which should be done about three or four times for not more than a minute or so at most each time, are to be practiced in a somewhat different way from the preceding ones.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>With eyes closed, repeat today‚Äôs idea to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then open your eyes, and look about you slowly, saying:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"415#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am looking at a meaningless world.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"415#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Repeat this statement to yourself as you look about.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then close your eyes, and conclude with:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"415#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>A meaningless world engenders fear because I think I am in competition with God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"415#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may find it difficult to avoid resistance, in one form or another, to this concluding statement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Whatever form such resistance may take, remind yourself that you are really afraid of such a thought because of the ‚Äúvengeance‚Äù of the ‚Äúenemy.‚Äù</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are not expected to believe the statement at this point, and will probably dismiss it as preposterous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Note carefully, however, any signs of overt or covert fear which it may arouse.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"415#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is our first attempt at stating an explicit cause and effect relationship of a kind which you are very inexperienced in recognizing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not dwell on the concluding statement, and try not even to think of it except during the practice periods.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"415#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That will suffice at present.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today‚Äôs idea is
