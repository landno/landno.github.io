is everything God created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are holy because all things He created are holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And all things He created are holy because you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In today‚Äôs exercises, we will apply the power of your holiness to all problems, difficulties or suffering in any form that you happen to think of, in yourself or in someone else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We will make no distinctions because there are no distinctions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"440#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span

search your mind for any sense of loss or unhappiness of any kind as you see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try to make as little distinction as possible between a situation that is difficult for you, and one that is difficult for someone else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Identify the situation specifically, and also the name of the person concerned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Use this form in applying the idea for today:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"440#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In the situation involving _________ in which I see myself, there is nothing that my holiness cannot do.<br/></span> <span

procedure, and add some relevant thoughts of your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You might like, for example, to include thoughts such as:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"440#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is nothing my holiness cannot do because the power of God lies in it.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"440#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Introduce whatever variations appeal to you, but keep the exercises focused on the theme, ‚ÄúThere is nothing my holiness cannot do.‚Äù</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The purpose of today‚Äôs exercises is to begin to instill in you a sense that you have dominion over all things because of what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"440#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the frequent shorter applications, apply the idea in its original form unless a specific problem concerning you or someone else arises, or comes to mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"440#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In that event, use the more specific form in applying the idea to it.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Your holiness reverses all the laws of the world.
