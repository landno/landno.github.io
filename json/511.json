data-sentence-id=\"511#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What can correct illusions but the truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what are errors but illusions that remain unrecognized for what they are?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Where truth has entered errors disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They merely vanish, leaving not a trace by which to be remembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are gone because, without belief, they have no life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And so they disappear to nothingness, returning whence they came.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>From dust to dust they come and go, for only truth remains.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Can you imagine what a state of mind without illusions is?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How it would feel?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Try to remember when there was a time,—perhaps a minute, maybe even less—when nothing came to interrupt your peace; when you were certain you were loved and safe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then try to picture what it would be like to have that moment be extended to the end of time and to eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Then let the sense of quiet that you felt be multiplied a hundred times, and then be multiplied another hundred more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And now you have a hint, not more than just the faintest intimation of the state your mind will rest in when the truth has come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Without illusions there could be no fear, no doubt and no attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When truth has come all pain is over, for there is no room for transitory thoughts and dead ideas to linger in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Truth occupies your mind completely, liberating you from all beliefs in the ephemeral.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They have no place because the truth has come, and they are nowhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They can not be found, for truth is everywhere forever, now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When truth has come it does not stay a while, to disappear or change to something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not shift and alter in its form, nor come and go and go and come again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It stays exactly as it always was, to be depended on in every need, and trusted with a perfect trust in all the seeming difficulties and the doubts that the appearances the world presents engender.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They will merely blow away, when truth corrects the errors in your mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When truth has come it harbors in its wings the gift of perfect constancy, and love which does not falter in the face of pain, but looks beyond it, steadily and sure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is the gift of healing, for the truth needs no defense, and therefore no attack is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Illusions can be brought to truth to be corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But the truth stands far beyond illusions, and can not be brought to them to turn them into truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth does not come and go nor shift nor change, in this appearance now and then in that, evading capture and escaping grasp.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not hide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It stands in open light, in obvious accessibility.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is impossible that anyone could seek it truly, and would not succeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Today belongs to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Give truth its due, and it will give you yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You were not meant to suffer and to die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your Father wills these dreams be gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let truth correct them all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We do not ask for what we do not have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We merely ask for what belongs to us, that we may recognize it as our own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Today we practice on the happy note of certainty that has been born of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The shaky and unsteady footsteps of illusion are not our approach today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We are as certain of success as we are sure we live and hope and breathe and think.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We do not doubt we walk with truth today, and count on it to enter into all the exercises that we do this day.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin by asking Him Who goes with you upon this undertaking that He be in your awareness as you go with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are not made of flesh and blood and bone, but were created by the selfsame Thought which gave the gift of life to Him as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is your Brother, and so like to you your Father knows that You are both the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is your Self you ask to go with you, and how could He be absent where you are?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth will correct all errors in your mind which tell you you could be apart from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You speak to Him today, and make your pledge to let His function be fulfilled through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To share His function is to share His joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His confidence is with you, as you say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"511#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Truth will correct all errors in my mind, and I will rest in Him Who is my Self.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"511#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then let Him lead you gently to the truth, which will envelop you and give you peace so deep and tranquil that you will return to the familiar world reluctantly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And yet you will be glad to look again upon this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you will bring with you the promise of the changes which the truth that goes with you will carry to the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They will increase with every gift you give of five small minutes, and the errors that surround the world will be corrected as you let them be corrected in your mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"511#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not forget your function for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"511#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each time you tell yourself with confidence, “Truth will correct all errors in my mind,” you speak for all the world and Him Who would release the world, as He would set you free.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"What can correct illusions but the truth?
