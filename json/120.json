data-sentence-id=\"120#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There <i>is</i> a rationale for choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only one Teacher knows what your reality is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If learning to remove the obstacles to that knowledge is the purpose of the curriculum, you must learn it of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego does not know what it is trying to teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is trying to teach you what you are without knowing what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is expert only in confusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It does not understand anything else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>As a teacher, then, the ego is totally confused and totally confusing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Even if you could disregard the Holy Spirit entirely, which is impossible, you could still learn nothing from the ego, because the ego knows nothing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"120#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is there any possible reason for choosing a teacher such as this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Does the total disregard of anything it teaches make anything but sense?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is this the teacher to whom a Son of God should turn to find himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego has never given you a sensible answer to anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Simply on the grounds of your own experience with its teaching, should not this alone disqualify it as your future teacher?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet the ego has done more harm to your learning than this alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Learning is joyful if it leads you along your natural path, and facilitates the development of what you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>When you are taught against your nature, however, you will lose by your learning because your learning will imprison you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your will is <i>in</i> your nature, and therefore cannot go against it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"120#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego cannot teach you anything as long as your will is free, because you will not listen to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not your will to be imprisoned because your will is free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is why the ego is the denial of free will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is never God Who coerces you, because He shares His Will with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His Voice teaches only in accordance with His Will, but that is not the Holy Spirit’s lesson because that is what you <i>are.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The lesson is that your will and God’s cannot be out of accord because they are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the undoing of everything the ego tries to teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is not, then, only the direction of the curriculum that must be unconflicted, but also the content.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"120#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego tries to teach that you want to oppose God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This unnatural lesson cannot be learned, and the attempt to learn it is a violation of your own freedom, making you afraid of your will <i>because</i> it is free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit opposes any imprisoning of the will of a Son of God, knowing that the Will of the Son is the Father’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit leads you steadily along the path of freedom, teaching you how to disregard or look beyond everything that would hold you back.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"120#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have said that the Holy Spirit teaches you the difference between pain and joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is the same as saying He teaches you the difference between imprisonment and freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot make this distinction without Him because you have taught yourself that imprisonment is freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Believing them to be the same, how can you tell them apart?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can you ask the part of your mind that taught you to believe they are the same, to teach you how they are different?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"120#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s teaching takes only <i>one</i> direction and has only <i>one</i> goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His direction is freedom and His goal is God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet He cannot conceive of God without you, because it is not God’s Will to <i>be</i> without you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you have learned that your will is God’s, you could no more will to be without Him than He could will to be without you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is freedom and this is joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Deny yourself this and you are denying God His Kingdom, because He created you for this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"120#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When I said, “All power and glory are yours because the Kingdom is His,” this is what I meant: The Will of God is without limit, and all power and glory lie within it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is boundless in strength and in love and in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It has no boundaries because its extension is unlimited, and it encompasses all things because it created all things.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By creating all things, it made them part of itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are the Will of God because that is how you were created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Because your Creator creates only like Himself, you are like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are part of Him Who is all power and glory, and are therefore as unlimited as He is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"120#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To what else except all power and glory can the Holy Spirit appeal to restore God’s Kingdom?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His appeal, then, is merely to what the Kingdom is, and for its own acknowledgment of what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you acknowledge this you bring the acknowledgment automatically to everyone, because you <i>have</i> acknowledged everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By your recognition you awaken theirs, and through theirs yours is extended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Awakening runs easily and gladly through the Kingdom, in answer to the Call for God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"120#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the natural response of every Son of God to the Voice for his Creator, because It is the Voice for his creations and for his own extension.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"There is a rationale for choice.
