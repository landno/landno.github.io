Prayer","inlineNumber":"II."},"annotation":"T-9.II","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-9-sect-2\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone who ever tried to use prayer to ask for something has experienced what appears to be failure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not only true in connection with specific things that might be harmful, but also in connection with requests that are strictly in line with this course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The latter in particular might be incorrectly interpreted as “proof” that the course does not mean what it says.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You must remember, however, that the course states, and repeatedly, that its purpose is the escape from fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us suppose, then, that what you ask of the Holy Spirit is what you really want, but you are still afraid of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Should this be the case, your attainment of it would no longer <i>be</i> what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is why certain specific forms of healing are not achieved, even when the state of healing is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>An individual may ask for physical healing because he is fearful of bodily harm.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>At the same time, if he were healed physically, the threat to his thought system might be considerably more fearful to him than its physical expression.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In this case he is not really asking for release from fear, but for the removal of a symptom that he himself selected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This request is, therefore, not for healing at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Bible emphasizes that all prayer is answered, and this is indeed true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The very fact that the Holy Spirit has been asked for anything will ensure a response.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it is equally certain that no response given by Him will ever be one that would increase fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is possible that His answer will not be heard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is impossible, however, that it will be lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There are many answers you have already received but have not yet heard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I assure you that they are waiting for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you would know your prayers are answered, never doubt a Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not question him and do not confound him, for your faith in him is your faith in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you would know God and His Answer, believe in me whose faith in you cannot be shaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Can you ask of the Holy Spirit truly, and doubt your brother?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Believe his words are true because of the truth that is in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will unite with the truth in him, and his words will <i>be</i> true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As you hear him you will hear me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Listening to truth is the only way you can hear it now, and finally know it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The message your brother gives you is up to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What does he say to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What would you have him say?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your decision about him determines the message you receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember that the Holy Spirit is in him, and His Voice speaks to you through him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What can so holy a brother tell you except truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But are you listening to it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your brother may not know who he is, but there is a light in his mind that does know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This light can shine into yours, giving truth to his words and making you able to hear them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>His words are the Holy Spirit’s answer to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Is your faith in him strong enough to let you hear?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can no more pray for yourself alone than you can find joy for yourself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Prayer is the restatement of inclusion, directed by the Holy Spirit under the laws of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Salvation is of your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit extends from your mind to his, and answers <i>you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You cannot hear the Voice for God in yourself alone, because you are not alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And His answer is only for what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You will not know the trust I have in you unless you extend it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You will not trust the guidance of the Holy Spirit, or believe that it is for you unless you hear it in others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It must be for your brother <i>because</i> it is for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Would God have created a Voice for you alone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Could you hear His answer except as He answers all of God’s Sons?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Hear of your brother what you would have me hear of you, for you would not want me to be deceived.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I love you for the truth in you, as God does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your deceptions may deceive you, but they cannot deceive me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Knowing what you are, I cannot doubt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I hear only the Holy Spirit in you, Who speaks to me through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you would hear me, hear my brothers in whom God’s Voice speaks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The answer to all prayers lies in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You will be answered as you hear the answer in everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not listen to anything else or you will not hear truly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Believe in your brothers because I believe in you, and you will learn that my belief in you is justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Believe in me <i>by</i> believing in them, for the sake of what God gave them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They will answer you if you learn to ask only truth of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not ask for blessings without blessing them, for only in this way can you learn how blessed you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>By following this way you are seeking the truth in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is not going beyond yourself but toward yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Hear only God’s Answer in His Sons, and you are answered.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To disbelieve is to side against, or to attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To believe is to accept, and to side with.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To believe is not to be credulous, but to accept and appreciate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you do not believe you do not appreciate, and you cannot be grateful for what you do not value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is a price you will pay for judgment, because judgment is the setting of a price.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And as you set it you will pay it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If paying is equated with getting, you will set the price low but demand a high return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will have forgotten, however, that to price is to value, so that your return is in proportion to your judgment of worth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If paying is associated with giving it cannot be perceived as loss, and the reciprocal relationship of giving and receiving will be recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The price will then be set high, because of the value of the return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The price for getting is to lose sight of value, making it inevitable that you will not value what you receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Valuing it little, you will not appreciate it and you will not want it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Never forget, then, that you set the value on what you receive, and price it by what you give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To believe that it is possible to get much for little is to believe that you can bargain with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s laws are always fair and perfectly consistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By giving you receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But to receive is to accept, not to get.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is impossible not to have, but it is possible not to know you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The recognition of having is the willingness for giving, and only by this willingness can you recognize what you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What you give is therefore the value you put on what you have, being the exact measure of the value you put upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And this, in turn, is the measure of how much you want it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"130#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can ask of the Holy Spirit, then, only by giving to Him, and you can give to Him only where you recognize Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you recognize Him in everyone, consider how much you will be asking of Him, and how much you will receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He will deny you nothing because you have denied Him nothing, and so you can share everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the way, and the only way to have His answer, because His answer is all you can ask for and want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"130#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Say, then, to everyone:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"130#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Because I will to know myself, I see you as God’s Son and my brother.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Everyone who ever tried to use prayer to ask for something has
