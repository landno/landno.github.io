data-sentence-id=\"836#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Strictly speaking, words play no part at all in healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The motivating factor is prayer, or asking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What you ask for you receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But this refers to the prayer of the heart, not to the words you use in praying.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Sometimes the words and the prayer are contradictory; sometimes they agree.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God does not understand words, for they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>They are thus twice removed from reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"836#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As symbols, words have quite specific references.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Even when they seem most abstract, the picture that comes to mind is apt to be very concrete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Unless a specific referent does occur to the mind in conjunction with the word, the word has little or no practical meaning, and thus cannot help the healing process.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The prayer of the heart does not really ask for concrete things.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It always requests some kind of experience, the specific things asked for being the bringers of the desired experience in the opinion of the asker.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The words, then, are symbols for the things asked for, but the things themselves but stand for the experiences that are hoped for.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"836#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The prayer for things of this world will bring experiences of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If the prayer of the heart asks for this, this will be given because this will be received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is impossible that the prayer of the heart remain unanswered in the perception of the one who asks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If he asks for the impossible, if he wants what does not exist or seeks for illusions in his heart, all this becomes his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The power of his decision offers it to him as he requests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Herein lie hell and Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The sleeping Son of God has but this power left to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is enough.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>His words do not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Only the Word of God has any meaning, because it symbolizes that which has no human symbols at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The Holy Spirit alone understands what this Word stands for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And this, too, is enough.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"836#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is the teacher of God, then, to avoid the use of words in his teaching?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No, indeed!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There are many who must be reached through words, being as yet unable to hear in silence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The teacher of God must, however, learn to use words in a new way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Gradually, he learns how to let his words be chosen for him by ceasing to decide for himself what he will say.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This process is merely a special case of the lesson in the workbook that says, “I will step back and let Him lead the way.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The teacher of God accepts the words which are offered him, and gives as he receives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He does not control the direction of his speaking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He listens and hears and speaks.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"836#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A major hindrance in this aspect of his learning is the teacher of God’s fear about the validity of what he hears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what he hears may indeed be quite startling.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It may also seem to be quite irrelevant to the presented problem as he perceives it, and may, in fact, confront the teacher with a situation that appears to be very embarrassing to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All these are judgments that have no value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are his own, coming from a shabby self-perception which he would leave behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Judge not the words that come to you, but offer them in confidence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are far wiser than your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God’s teachers have God’s Word behind their symbols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"836#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And He Himself gives to the words they use the power of His Spirit, raising them from meaningless symbols to the Call of Heaven itself.</span></p></div>
