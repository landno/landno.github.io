class=\"snr\">2</span>Its aim is to aid the patient in abandoning his fixed delusional system, and to begin to reconsider the spurious cause and effect relationships on which it rests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one in this world escapes fear, but everyone can reconsider its causes and learn to evaluate them correctly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God has given everyone a Teacher Whose wisdom and help far exceed whatever contributions an earthly therapist can provide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet there are times and situations in which an earthly patient-therapist relationship becomes the means through which He offers His greater gifts to both.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"902#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What better purpose could any relationship have than to invite the Holy Spirit to enter into it and give it His Own great gift of rejoicing?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What higher goal could there be for anyone than to learn to call upon God and hear His Answer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what more transcendent aim can there be than to recall the way, the truth and the life, and to remember God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To help in this is the proper purpose of psychotherapy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Could anything be holier?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For psychotherapy, correctly understood, teaches forgiveness and helps the patient to recognize and accept it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in his healing is the therapist forgiven with him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"902#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone who needs help, regardless of the form of his distress, is attacking himself, and his peace of mind is suffering in consequence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These tendencies are often described as “self-destructive,” and the patient often regards them in that way himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What he does not realize and needs to learn is that this “self,” which can attack and be attacked as well, is a concept he made up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Further, he cherishes it, defends it, and is sometimes even willing to “sacrifice” his “life” on its behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For he regards it as himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This self he sees as being acted on, reacting to external forces as they demand, and helpless midst the power of the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"902#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Psychotherapy, then, must restore to his awareness the ability to make his own decisions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He must become willing to reverse his thinking, and to understand that what he thought projected its effects on him were made by his projections on the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world he sees does therefore not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Until this is at least in part accepted, the patient cannot see himself as really capable of making decisions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And he will fight against his freedom because he thinks that it is slavery.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"902#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The patient need not think of truth as God in order to make progress in salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But he must begin to separate truth from illusion, recognizing that they are not the same, and becoming increasingly willing to see illusions as false and to accept the truth as true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Teacher will take him on from there, as far as he is ready to go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Psychotherapy can only save him time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit uses time as He thinks best, and He is never wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Psychotherapy under His direction is one of the means He uses to save time, and to prepare additional teachers for His work.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no end to the help that He begins and He directs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>By whatever routes He chooses, all psychotherapy leads to God in the end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But that is up to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"902#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>We are all His psychotherapists, for He would have us all be healed in Him.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Very simply, the purpose of psychotherapy is to remove the blocks to truth.
