class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who were created by love like itself can hold no grievances and know your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To hold a grievance is to forget who you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To hold a grievance is to see yourself as a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To hold a grievance is to let the ego rule your mind and to condemn the body to death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perhaps you do not yet fully realize just what holding grievances does to your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It seems to split you off from your Source and make you unlike Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It makes you believe that He is like what you think you have become, for no one can conceive of his Creator as unlike himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"471#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Shut off from your Self, which remains aware of Its likeness to Its Creator, your Self seems to sleep, while the part of your mind that weaves illusions in its sleep appears to be awake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can all this arise from holding grievances?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Oh, yes!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For he who holds grievances denies he was created by love, and his Creator has become fearful to him in his dream of hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who can dream of hatred and not fear God?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"471#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is as sure that those who hold grievances will redefine God in their own image, as it is certain that God created them like Himself, and defined them as part of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is as sure that those who hold grievances will suffer guilt, as it is certain that those who forgive will find peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is as sure that those who hold grievances will forget who they are, as it is certain that those who forgive will remember.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"471#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you not be willing to relinquish your grievances if you believed all this were so?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you do not think you can let your grievances go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That, however, is simply a matter of motivation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Today we will try to find out how you would feel without them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you succeed even by ever so little, there will never be a problem in motivation ever again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"471#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin today‚Äôs extended practice period by searching your mind for those against whom you hold what you regard as major grievances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Some of these will be quite easy to find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then think of the seemingly minor grievances you hold against those you like and even think you love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It will quickly become apparent that there is no one against whom you do not cherish grievances of some sort.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This has left you alone in all the universe in your perception of yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"471#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Determine now to see all these people as friends.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Say to them all, thinking of each one in turn as you do so:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"471#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I would see you as my friend, that I may remember you are part of me and come to know myself.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"471#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Spend the remainder of the practice period trying to think of yourself as completely at peace with everyone and everything, safe in a world that protects you and loves you, and that you love in return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Try to feel safety surrounding you, hovering over you and holding you up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Try to believe, however briefly, that nothing can harm you in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>At the end of the practice period tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"471#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Love holds no grievances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>When I let all my grievances go I will know I am perfectly safe.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"471#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The short practice periods should include a quick application of today‚Äôs idea in this form, whenever any thought of grievance arises against anyone, physically present or not:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"471#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love holds no grievances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let me not betray my Self.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"471#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In addition, repeat the idea several times an hour in this form:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"471#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Love holds no grievances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"471#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I would wake to my Self by laying all my grievances aside and wakening in Him.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You who were created by love like itself can hold no grievances and know your Self.
