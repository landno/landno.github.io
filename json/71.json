class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A further point must be perfectly clear before any residual fear still associated with miracles can disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The crucifixion did not establish the Atonement; the resurrection did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Many sincere Christians have misunderstood this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one who is free of the belief in scarcity could possibly make this mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If the crucifixion is seen from an upside-down point of view, it does appear as if God permitted and even encouraged one of His Sons to suffer because he was good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This particularly unfortunate interpretation, which arose out of projection, has led many people to be bitterly afraid of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Such anti-religious concepts enter into many religions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet the real Christian should pause and ask, “How could this be?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Is it likely that God Himself would be capable of the kind of thinking which His Own words have clearly stated is unworthy of His Son?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"071#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The best defense, as always, is not to attack another’s position, but rather to protect the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is unwise to accept any concept if you have to invert a whole frame of reference in order to justify it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This procedure is painful in its minor applications and genuinely tragic on a wider scale.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Persecution frequently results in an attempt to “justify” the terrible misperception that God Himself persecuted His Own Son on behalf of salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The very words are meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It has been particularly difficult to overcome this because, although the error itself is no harder to correct than any other, many have been unwilling to give it up in view of its prominent value as a defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In milder forms a parent says, “This hurts me more than it hurts you,” and feels exonerated in beating a child.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can you believe our Father really thinks this way?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is so essential that all such thinking be dispelled that we must be sure that nothing of this kind remains in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I was not “punished” because <i>you</i> were bad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The wholly benign lesson the Atonement teaches is lost if it is tainted with this kind of distortion in any form.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"071#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The statement “Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord” is a misperception by which one assigns his own “evil” past to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The “evil” past has nothing to do with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He did not create it and He does not maintain it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God does not believe in retribution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His Mind does not create that way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He does not hold your “evil” deeds against you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Is it likely that He would hold them against me?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Be very sure that you recognize how utterly impossible this assumption is, and how entirely it arises from projection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This kind of error is responsible for a host of related errors, including the belief that God rejected Adam and forced him out of the Garden of Eden.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is also why you may believe from time to time that I am misdirecting you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>I have made every effort to use words that are almost impossible to distort, but it is always possible to twist symbols around if you wish.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"071#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sacrifice is a notion totally unknown to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It arises solely from fear, and frightened people can be vicious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Sacrificing in any way is a violation of my injunction that you should be merciful even as your Father in Heaven is merciful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It has been hard for many Christians to realize that this applies to themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Good teachers never terrorize their students.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To terrorize is to attack, and this results in rejection of what the teacher offers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The result is learning failure.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"071#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have been correctly referred to as “the lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world,” but those who represent the lamb as blood-stained do not understand the meaning of the symbol.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Correctly understood, it is a very simple symbol that speaks of my innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The lion and the lamb lying down together symbolize that strength and innocence are not in conflict, but naturally live in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>“Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God” is another way of saying the same thing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A pure mind knows the truth and this is its strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It does not confuse destruction with innocence because it associates innocence with strength, not with weakness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"071#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Innocence is incapable of sacrificing anything, because the innocent mind has everything and strives only to protect its wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It cannot project.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It can only honor other minds, because honor is the natural greeting of the truly loved to others who are like them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The lamb “taketh away the sins of the world” in the sense that the state of innocence, or grace, is one in which the meaning of the Atonement is perfectly apparent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Atonement is entirely unambiguous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is perfectly clear because it exists in light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only the attempts to shroud it in darkness have made it inaccessible to those who do not choose to see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"071#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Atonement itself radiates nothing but truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It therefore epitomizes harmlessness and sheds only blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It could not do this if it arose from anything but perfect innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Innocence is wisdom because it is unaware of evil, and evil does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is, however, perfectly aware of everything that is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The resurrection demonstrated that nothing can destroy truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Good can withstand any form of evil, as light abolishes forms of darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Atonement is therefore the perfect lesson.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is the final demonstration that all the other lessons I taught are true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If you can accept this one generalization now, there will be no need to learn from many smaller lessons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You are released from all errors if you believe this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"071#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The innocence of God is the true state of the mind of His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this state your mind knows God, for God is not symbolic; He is Fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Knowing His Son as he is, you realize that the Atonement, not sacrifice, is the only appropriate gift for God’s altar, where nothing except perfection belongs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The understanding of the innocent is truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"071#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is why their altars are truly radiant.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"A further point must be perfectly clear before any residual fear still associated with miracles can disappear.
