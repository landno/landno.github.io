class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea for today can be regarded as the central thought toward which all our exercises are directed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God‚Äôs is the only Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you have recognized this, you have recognized that your will is His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The belief that conflict is possible has gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Peace has replaced the strange idea that you are torn by conflicting goals.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As an expression of the Will of God, you have no goal but His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"477#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is great peace in today‚Äôs idea, and the exercises for today are directed towards finding it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The idea itself is wholly true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore it cannot give rise to illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Without illusions conflict is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let us try to recognize this today, and experience the peace this recognition brings.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"477#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin the longer practice periods by repeating these thoughts several times, slowly and with firm determination to understand what they mean, and to hold them in mind:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no will but God‚Äôs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I cannot be in conflict.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then spend several minutes in adding some related thoughts, such as:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I am at peace.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing can disturb me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>My will is God‚Äôs.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>My will and God‚Äôs are one.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>God wills peace for His Son.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>During this introductory phase, be sure to deal quickly with any conflict thoughts that may cross your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Tell yourself immediately:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>There is no will but God‚Äôs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#3:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>These conflict thoughts are meaningless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"477#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If there is one conflict area that seems particularly difficult to resolve, single it out for special consideration.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Think about it briefly but very specifically, identify the particular person or persons and the situation or situations involved, and tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"477#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no will but God‚Äôs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I share it with Him.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>My conflicts about _________ cannot be real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"477#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>After you have cleared your mind in this way, close your eyes and try to experience the peace to which your reality entitles you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Sink into it and feel it closing around you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There may be some temptation to mistake these attempts for withdrawal, but the difference is easily detected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you are succeeding, you will feel a deep sense of joy and an increased alertness, rather than a feeling of drowsiness and enervation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"477#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Joy characterizes peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>By this experience will you recognize that you have reached it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you feel yourself slipping off into withdrawal, quickly repeat the idea for today and try again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do this as often as necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is definite gain in refusing to allow retreat into withdrawal, even if you do not experience the peace you seek.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"477#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the shorter periods, which should be undertaken at regular and predetermined intervals today, say to yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"477#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no will but God‚Äôs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I seek His peace today.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"477#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then try to find what you are seeking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"477#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A minute or two every half an hour, with eyes closed if possible, would be well spent on this today.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The idea for today can be regarded as the central thought toward which all our exercises are directed.
