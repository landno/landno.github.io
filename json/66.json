<span data-sentence-id=\"066#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(1) The miracle abolishes the need for lower-order concerns.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#11:2\"><span

class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(2) A clear distinction between what is created and what is made is essential.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All forms of healing rest on this fundamental correction in level perception.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"066#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(3) Never confuse right- and wrong-mindedness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Responding to any form of error with anything except a desire to heal is an expression of this confusion.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"066#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(4) The miracle is always a denial of this error and an affirmation of the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only right-mindedness can correct in a way that has any real effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Pragmatically, what has no real effect has no real existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its effect, then, is emptiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Being without substantial content, it lends itself to projection.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"066#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(5) The level-adjustment power of the miracle induces the right perception for healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Until this has occurred healing cannot be understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiveness is an empty gesture unless it entails correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Without this it is essentially judgmental, rather than healing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"066#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(6) Miracle-minded forgiveness is <i>only</i> correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has no element of judgment at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The statement “Father forgive them for they know not what they do” in no way evaluates <i>what</i> they do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is an appeal to God to heal their minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no reference to the outcome of the error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That does not matter.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"066#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(7) The injunction “Be of one mind” is the statement for revelation-readiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>My request “Do this in remembrance of me” is the appeal for cooperation from miracle workers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The two statements are not in the same order of reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only the latter involves an awareness of time, since to remember is to recall the past in the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Time is under my direction, but timelessness belongs to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#17:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In time we exist for and with each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#17:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In timelessness we coexist with God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"066#18\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">18.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#18:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>(8) You can do much on behalf of your own healing and that of others if, in a situation calling for help, you think of it this way:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"066#18:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I am here only to be truly helpful.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#18:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I am here to represent Him Who sent me.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#18:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I do not have to worry about what to say or what to do, because He Who sent me will direct me.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#18:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I am content to be wherever He wishes, knowing He goes there with me.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"066#18:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I will be healed as I let Him teach me to heal.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"(1) The miracle abolishes the need for
