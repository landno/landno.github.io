data-sentence-id=\"188#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet the essential thing is learning that <i>you do not know.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Knowledge is power, and all power is of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You who have tried to keep power for yourself have “lost” it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You still have the power, but you have interposed so much between it and your awareness of it that you cannot use it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everything you have taught yourself has made your power more and more obscure to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You know not what it is, nor where.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have made a semblance of power and a show of strength so pitiful that it must fail you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For power is not a seeming strength, and truth is beyond semblance of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet all that stands between you and the power of God in you is but your learning of the false, and of your attempts to undo the true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be willing, then, for all of it to be undone, and be glad that you are not bound to it forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you have taught yourself how to imprison the Son of God, a lesson so unthinkable that only the insane, in deepest sleep, could even dream of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Can God learn how not to be God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And can His Son, given all power by Him, learn to be powerless?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What have you taught yourself that you can possibly prefer to keep, in place of what you <i>have</i> and what you <i>are</i>?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Atonement teaches you how to escape forever from everything that you have taught yourself in the past, by showing you only what you are <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Learning has been accomplished before its effects are manifest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Learning is therefore in the past, but its influence determines the present by giving it whatever meaning it holds for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span><i>Your</i> learning gives the present no meaning at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothing you have ever learned can help you understand the present, or teach you how to undo the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your past is what you have taught yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span><i>Let it all go.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not attempt to understand any event or anything or anyone in its “light,” for the darkness in which you try to see can only obscure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Put no confidence at all in darkness to illuminate your understanding, for if you do you contradict the light, and thereby think you see the darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet darkness cannot be seen, for it is nothing more than a condition in which seeing becomes impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who have not yet brought all of the darkness you have taught yourself into the light in you, can hardly judge the truth and value of this course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet God did not abandon you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so you have another lesson sent from Him, already learned for every child of light by Him to Whom God gave it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This lesson shines with God’s glory, for in it lies His power, which He shares so gladly with His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Learn of His happiness, which is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But to accomplish this, all your dark lessons must be brought willingly to truth, and joyously laid down by hands open to receive, not closed to take.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Every dark lesson that you bring to Him Who teaches light He will accept from you, because you do not want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And He will gladly exchange each one for the bright lesson He has learned for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Never believe that any lesson you have learned apart from Him means anything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have one test, as sure as God, by which to recognize if what you learned is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you are wholly free of fear of any kind, and if all those who meet or even think of you share in your perfect peace, then you can be sure that you have learned God’s lesson, and not your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Unless all this is true, there are dark lessons in your mind that hurt and hinder you, and everyone around you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The absence of perfect peace means but one thing: You think you do not will for God’s Son what his Father wills for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Every dark lesson teaches this, in one form or another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And each bright lesson with which the Holy Spirit will replace the dark ones you do not accept, teaches you that you will with the Father and His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not be concerned about how you can learn a lesson so completely different from everything that you have taught yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How would you know?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your part is very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You need only recognize that everything you learned you do not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Ask to be taught, and do not use your experiences to confirm what you have learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When your peace is threatened or disturbed in any way, say to yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I do not know what anything, including this, means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so I do not know how to respond to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And I will not use my own past learning as the light to guide me now.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>By this refusal to attempt to teach yourself what you do not know, the Guide Whom God has given you will speak to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>He will take His rightful place in your awareness the instant you abandon it, and offer it to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot be your guide to miracles, for it is you who made them necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And because you did, the means on which you can depend for miracles has been provided for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s Son can make no needs his Father will not meet, if he but turn to Him ever so little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet He cannot compel His Son to turn to Him and remain Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is impossible that God lose His Identity, for if He did, you would lose yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And being yours He cannot change Himself, for your Identity is changeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The miracle acknowledges His changelessness by seeing His Son as he always was, and not as he would make himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The miracle brings the effects that only guiltlessness can bring, and thus establishes the fact that guiltlessness must be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can you, so firmly bound to guilt and committed so to remain, establish for yourself your guiltlessness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But be sure that you are willing to acknowledge that it <i>is</i> impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is only because you think that you can run some little part, or deal with certain aspects of your life alone, that the guidance of the Holy Spirit is limited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus would you make Him undependable, and use this fancied undependability as an excuse for keeping certain dark lessons from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And by so limiting the guidance that you would accept, you are unable to depend on miracles to answer all your problems for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do you think that what the Holy Spirit would have you give He would withhold from you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have no problems that He cannot solve by offering you a miracle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Miracles are for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And every fear or pain or trial you have has been undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has brought all of them to light, having accepted them instead of you, and recognized they never were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There are no dark lessons He has not already lightened for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The lessons you would teach yourself He has corrected already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They do not exist in His Mind at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For the past binds Him not, and therefore binds not you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He does not see time as you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And each miracle He offers you corrects your use of time, and makes it His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He Who has freed you from the past would teach you are free of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He would but have you accept His accomplishments as yours, because He did them for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And because He did, they <i>are</i> yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has made you free of what you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can deny Him, but you cannot call on Him in vain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He always gives His gifts in place of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He would establish His bright teaching so firmly in your mind, that no dark lesson of guilt can abide in what He has established as holy by His Presence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Thank God that He is there and works through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And all His works are yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He offers you a miracle with every one you let Him do through you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s Son will always be indivisible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As we are held as one in God, so do we learn as one in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s Teacher is as like to His Creator as is His Son, and through His Teacher does God proclaim His Oneness and His Son’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Listen in silence, and do not raise your voice against Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For He teaches the miracle of oneness, and before His lesson division disappears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Teach like Him here, and you will remember that you have always created like your Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The miracle of creation has never ceased, having the holy stamp of immortality upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is the Will of God for all creation, and all creation joins in willing this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those who remember always that they know nothing, and who have become willing to learn everything, will learn it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But whenever they trust themselves, they will not learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They have destroyed their motivation for learning by thinking they already know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think not you understand anything until you pass the test of perfect peace, for peace and understanding go together and never can be found alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each brings the other with it, for it is the law of God they be not separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They are cause and effect, each to the other, so where one is absent the other cannot be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"188#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only those who recognize they cannot know unless the effects of understanding are with them, can really learn at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this it must be peace they want, and nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whenever you think you know, peace will depart from you, because you have abandoned the Teacher of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whenever you fully realize that you know not, peace will return, for you will have invited Him to do so by abandoning the ego on behalf of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Call not upon the ego for anything; it is only this that you need do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#13:6\"><span

will never reciprocate, for His faith in you is His understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is as firm as is His faith in His Creator, and He knows that faith in His Creator must encompass faith in His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In this consistency lies His Holiness which He cannot abandon, for it is not His Will to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>With your perfection ever in His sight, He gives the gift of peace to everyone who perceives the need for peace, and who would have it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Make way for peace, and it will come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"188#14:8\"><span
