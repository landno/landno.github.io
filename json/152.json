data-sentence-id=\"152#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world as you perceive it cannot have been created by the Father, for the world is not as you see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God created only the eternal, and everything you see is perishable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, there must be another world that you do not see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Bible speaks of a new Heaven and a new earth, yet this cannot be literally true, for the eternal are not re-created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To perceive anew is merely to perceive again, implying that before, or in the interval between, you were not perceiving at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What, then, is the world that awaits your perception when you see it?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"152#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every loving thought that the Son of God ever had is eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The loving thoughts his mind perceives in this world are the world’s only reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are still perceptions, because he still believes that he is separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet they are eternal because they are loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And being loving they are like the Father, and therefore cannot die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The real world can actually be perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All that is necessary is a willingness to perceive nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For if you perceive both good and evil, you are accepting both the false and the true and making no distinction between them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"152#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego may see some good, but never only good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is why its perceptions are so variable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It does not reject goodness entirely, for that you could not accept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But it always adds something that is not real to the real, thus confusing illusion and reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For perceptions cannot be partly true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you believe in truth and illusion, you cannot tell which is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To establish your personal autonomy you tried to create unlike your Father, believing that what you made is capable of being unlike Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet everything true <i>is</i> like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Perceiving only the real world will lead you to the real Heaven, because it will make you capable of understanding it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"152#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The perception of goodness is not knowledge, but the denial of the opposite of goodness enables you to recognize a condition in which opposites do not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this <i>is</i> the condition of knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Without this awareness you have not met its conditions, and until you do you will not know it is yours already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have made many ideas that you have placed between yourself and your Creator, and these beliefs are the world as you perceive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Truth is not absent here, but it is obscure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not know the difference between what you have made and what God created, and so you do not know the difference between what you have made and what <i>you</i> have created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To believe that you can perceive the real world is to believe that you can know yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You can know God because it is His Will to be known.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"152#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The real world is all that the Holy Spirit has saved for you out of what you have made, and to perceive only this is salvation, because it is the recognition that reality is only what is true.</span></p></div>
