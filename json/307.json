data-sentence-id=\"307#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is healing frightening?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To many, yes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For accusation is a bar to love, and damaged bodies are accusers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They stand firmly in the way of trust and peace, proclaiming that the frail can have no trust and that the damaged have no grounds for peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who has been injured by his brother, and could love and trust him still?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He has attacked and will attack again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Protect him not, because your damaged body shows that <i>you</i> must be protected from him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To forgive may be an act of charity, but not his due.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He may be pitied for his guilt, but not exonerated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And if you forgive him his transgressions, you but add to all the guilt that he has really earned.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The unhealed cannot pardon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For they are the witnesses that pardon is unfair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They would retain the consequences of the guilt they overlook.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet no one can forgive a sin that he believes is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what has consequences must be real, because what it has done is there to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Forgiveness is not pity, which but seeks to pardon what it thinks to be the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Good cannot <i>be</i> returned for evil, for forgiveness does not first establish sin and then forgive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Who can say and mean, “My brother, you have injured me, and yet, because I am the better of the two, I pardon you my hurt.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>His pardon and your hurt cannot exist together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>One denies the other and must make it false.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To witness sin and yet forgive it is a paradox that reason cannot see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it maintains what has been done to you deserves no pardon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And by giving it, you grant your brother mercy but retain the proof he is not really innocent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The sick remain accusers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They cannot forgive their brothers and themselves as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For no one in whom true forgiveness rests can suffer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He holds not the proof of sin before his brother’s eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And thus he must have overlooked it and removed it from his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Forgiveness cannot be for one and not the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Who forgives is healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And in his healing lies the proof that he has truly pardoned, and retains no trace of condemnation that he still would hold against himself or any living thing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness is not real unless it brings a healing to your brother and yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You must attest his sins have no effect on you to demonstrate they are not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How else could he be guiltless?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And how could his innocence be justified unless his sins have no effect to warrant guilt?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Sins are beyond forgiveness just because they would entail effects that cannot be undone and overlooked entirely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In their undoing lies the proof that they are merely errors.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let yourself be healed that you may be forgiving, offering salvation to your brother and yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A broken body shows the mind has not been healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A miracle of healing proves that separation is without effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What you would prove to him you will believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The power of witness comes from your belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And everything you say or do or think but testifies to what you teach to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your body can be means to teach that it has never suffered pain because of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in its healing can it offer him mute testimony of his innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is this testimony that can speak with power greater than a thousand tongues.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For here is his forgiveness proved to him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A miracle can offer nothing less to him than it has given unto you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So does your healing show your mind is healed, and has forgiven what he did not do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so is he convinced his innocence was never lost, and healed along with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus does the miracle undo all things the world attests can never be undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And hopelessness and death must disappear before the ancient clarion call of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This call has power far beyond the weak and miserable cry of death and guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ancient calling of the Father to His Son, and of the Son unto His Own, will yet be the last trumpet that the world will ever hear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Brother, there is no death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And this you learn when you but wish to show your brother that you had no hurt of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He thinks your blood is on his hands, and so he stands condemned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet it is given you to show him, by your healing, that his guilt is but the fabric of a senseless dream.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How just are miracles!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For they bestow an equal gift of full deliverance from guilt upon your brother and yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your healing saves him pain as well as you, and you are healed because you wished him well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the law the miracle obeys; that healing sees no specialness at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It does not come from pity but from love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And love would prove all suffering is but a vain imagining, a foolish wish with no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your health is a result of your desire to see your brother with no blood upon his hands, nor guilt upon his heart made heavy with the proof of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And what you wish is given you to see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The “cost” of your serenity is his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the “price” the Holy Spirit and the world interpret differently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world perceives it as a statement of the “fact” that your salvation sacrifices his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit knows your healing is the witness unto his, and cannot be apart from his at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As long as he consents to suffer, you will be unhealed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet you can show him that his suffering is purposeless and wholly without cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Show him your healing, and he will consent no more to suffer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For his innocence has been established in your sight and his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And laughter will replace your sighs, because God’s Son remembered that he <i>is</i> God’s Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who, then, fears healing?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only those to whom their brother’s sacrifice and pain are seen to represent their own serenity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Their helplessness and weakness represent the grounds on which they justify his pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The constant sting of guilt he suffers serves to prove that he is slave, but they are free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The constant pain they suffer demonstrates that they are free <i>because</i> they hold him bound.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And sickness is desired to prevent a shift of balance in the sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How could the Holy Spirit be deterred an instant, even less, to reason with an argument for sickness such as this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And need your healing be delayed because you pause to listen to insanity?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Correction is not your function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It belongs to One Who knows of fairness, not of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you assume correction’s role, you lose the function of forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one can forgive until he learns correction is but to forgive, and never to accuse.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Alone, you cannot see they are the same, and therefore is correction not of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Identity and function are the same, and by your function do you know yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And thus, if you confuse your function with the function of Another, you must be confused about yourself and who you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What is the separation but a wish to take God’s function from Him and deny that it is His?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet if it is not His it is not yours, for you must lose what you would take away.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In a split mind, identity must seem to be divided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor can anyone perceive a function unified which has conflicting purposes and different ends.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Correction, to a mind so split, must be a way to punish sins you think are yours in someone else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thus does he become your victim, not your brother, different from you in that he is more guilty, thus in need of your correction, as the one more innocent than he.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This splits his function off from yours, and gives you both a different role.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And so you cannot be perceived as one, and with a single function that would mean a shared identity with but one end.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Correction <i>you</i> would do must separate, because that is the function given it <i>by</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you perceive correction is the same as pardon, then you also know the Holy Spirit’s Mind and yours are One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so your own Identity is found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet must He work with what is given Him, and you allow Him only half your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus He represents the other half, and seems to have a different purpose from the one you cherish, and you think is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thus does your function seem divided, with a half in opposition to a half.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And these two halves appear to represent a split within a self perceived as two.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Consider how this self-perception must extend, and do not overlook the fact that every thought extends because that is its purpose, being what it really is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From an idea of self as two, there comes a necessary view of function split between the two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what you would correct is only half the error, which you think is all of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your brother’s sins become the central target for correction, lest your errors and his own be seen as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yours are mistakes, but his are sins and not the same as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His merit punishment, while yours, in fairness, should be overlooked.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this interpretation of correction, your own mistakes you will not even see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The focus of correction has been placed outside yourself, on one who cannot be a part of you while this perception lasts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What is condemned can never be returned to its accuser, who had hated it, and hates it still as symbol of his fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is your brother, focus of your hate, unworthy to be part of you and thus outside yourself; the other half, which is denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And only what is left without his presence is perceived as all of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To this remaining half the Holy Spirit must represent the other half until you recognize it <i>is</i> the other half.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And this He does by giving you and him a function that is one, not different.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Correction is the function given both, but neither one alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And when it is fulfilled as shared, it must correct mistakes in you and him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It cannot leave mistakes in one unhealed and set the other free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is divided purpose, which can not be shared, and so it cannot be the goal in which the Holy Spirit sees His Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you can rest assured that He will not fulfill a function that He does not see and recognize as His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For only thus can He keep yours preserved intact, despite Your separate views of what your function is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If He upheld divided function, you were lost indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#15:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>His inability to see His goal divided and distinct for you and him, preserves yourself from the awareness of a function not your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#15:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And thus is healing given you and him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"307#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#16:1\"><span class=\"snr

understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Leave, then, correction to the Mind that is united, functioning as one because it is not split in purpose, and conceives a single function as its only one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"307#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here is the function given it conceived to be its Own, and not apart from that its
