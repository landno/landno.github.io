data-sentence-id=\"531#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today’s idea, completely alien to the ego and the thinking of the world, is crucial to the thought reversal that this course will bring about.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you believed this statement, there would be no problem in complete forgiveness, certainty of goal, and sure direction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You would understand the means by which salvation comes to you, and would not hesitate to use it now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us consider what you do believe, in place of this idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It seems to you that other people are apart from you, and able to behave in ways which have no bearing on your thoughts, nor yours on theirs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, your attitudes have no effect on them, and their appeals for help are not in any way related to your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You further think that they can sin without affecting your perception of yourself, while you can judge their sin, and yet remain apart from condemnation and at peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you “forgive” a sin, there is no gain to you directly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You give charity to one unworthy, merely to point out that you are better, on a higher plane than he whom you forgive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has not earned your charitable tolerance, which you bestow on one unworthy of the gift, because his sins have lowered him beneath a true equality with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has no claim on your forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It holds out a gift to him, but hardly to yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus is forgiveness basically unsound; a charitable whim, benevolent yet undeserved, a gift bestowed at times, at other times withheld.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Unmerited, withholding it is just, nor is it fair that you should suffer when it is withheld.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The sin that you forgive is not your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Someone apart from you committed it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And if you then are gracious unto him by giving him what he does not deserve, the gift is no more yours than was his sin.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If this be true, forgiveness has no grounds on which to rest dependably and sure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is an eccentricity, in which you sometimes choose to give indulgently an undeserved reprieve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it remains your right to let the sinner not escape the justified repayment for his sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think you the Lord of Heaven would allow the world’s salvation to depend on this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would not His care for you be small indeed, if your salvation rested on a whim?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not understand forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As you see it, it is but a check upon overt attack, without requiring correction in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It cannot give you peace as you perceive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not a means for your release from what you see in someone other than yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It has no power to restore your unity with him to your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is not what God intended it to be for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Not having given Him the gift He asks of you, you cannot recognize His gifts, and think He has not given them to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet would He ask you for a gift unless it was for you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Could He be satisfied with empty gestures, and evaluate such petty gifts as worthy of His Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation is a better gift than this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And true forgiveness, as the means by which it is attained, must heal the mind that gives, for giving is receiving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What remains as unreceived has not been given, but what has been given must have been received.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we try to understand the truth that giver and receiver are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will need help to make this meaningful, because it is so alien to the thoughts to which you are accustomed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But the Help you need is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Give Him your faith today, and ask Him that He share your practicing in truth today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And if you only catch a tiny glimpse of the release that lies in the idea we practice for today, this is a day of glory for the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Give fifteen minutes twice today to the attempt to understand today’s idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the thought by which forgiveness takes its proper place in your priorities.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the thought that will release your mind from every bar to what forgiveness means, and let you realize its worth to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In silence, close your eyes upon the world that does not understand forgiveness, and seek sanctuary in the quiet place where thoughts are changed and false beliefs laid by.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Repeat today’s idea, and ask for help in understanding what it really means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Be willing to be taught.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Be glad to hear the Voice of truth and healing speak to you, and you will understand the words He speaks, and recognize He speaks your words to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"531#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As often as you can, remind yourself you have a goal today; an aim which makes this day of special value to yourself and all your brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not let your mind forget this goal for long, but tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"531#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All that I give is given to myself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Help I need to learn that this is true is with me now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And I will trust in Him.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"531#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then spend a quiet moment, opening your mind to His correction and His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"531#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And what you hear of Him you will believe, for what He gives will be received by you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today’s idea,
