data-sentence-id=\"545#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>“Cure” is a word that cannot be applied to any remedy the world accepts as beneficial.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What the world perceives as therapeutic is but what will make the body “better.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When it tries to heal the mind, it sees no separation from the body, where it thinks the mind exists.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its forms of healing thus must substitute illusion for illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>One belief in sickness takes another form, and so the patient now perceives himself as well.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He is not healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He merely had a dream that he was sick, and in the dream he found a magic formula to make him well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet he has not awakened from the dream, and so his mind remains exactly as it was before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has not seen the light that would awaken him and end the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What difference does the content of a dream make in reality?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>One either sleeps or wakens.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is nothing in between.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The happy dreams the Holy Spirit brings are different from the dreaming of the world, where one can merely dream he is awake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The dreams forgiveness lets the mind perceive do not induce another form of sleep, so that the dreamer dreams another dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His happy dreams are heralds of the dawn of truth upon the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They lead from sleep to gentle waking, so that dreams are gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus they cure for all eternity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Atonement heals with certainty, and cures all sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the mind which understands that sickness can be nothing but a dream is not deceived by forms the dream may take.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Sickness where guilt is absent cannot come, for it is but another form of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Atonement does not heal the sick, for that is not a cure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It takes away the guilt that makes the sickness possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And that is cure indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For sickness now is gone, with nothing left to which it can return.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Peace be to you who have been cured in God, and not in idle dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For cure must come from holiness, and holiness can not be found where sin is cherished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God abides in holy temples.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He is barred where sin has entered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet there is no place where He is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And therefore sin can have no home in which to hide from His beneficence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no place where holiness is not, and nowhere sin and sickness can abide.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the thought that cures.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not make distinctions among unrealities.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor does it seek to heal what is not sick, unmindful where the need for healing is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is no magic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is merely an appeal to truth, which cannot fail to heal and heal forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is not a thought that judges an illusion by its size, its seeming gravity, or anything that is related to the form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It merely focuses on what it is, and knows that no illusion can be real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us not try today to seek to cure what cannot suffer sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Healing must be sought but where it is, and then applied to what is sick, so that it can be cured.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no remedy the world provides that can effect a change in anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The mind that brings illusions to the truth is really changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no change but this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For how can one illusion differ from another but in attributes that have no substance, no reality, no core, and nothing that is truly different?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we seek to change our minds about the source of sickness, for we seek a cure for all illusions, not another shift among them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will try today to find the source of healing, which is in our minds because our Father placed it there for us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not farther from us than ourselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is as near to us as our own thoughts; so close it is impossible to lose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We need but seek it and it must be found.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will not be misled today by what appears to us as sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We go beyond appearances today and reach the source of healing, from which nothing is exempt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will succeed to the extent to which we realize that there can never be a meaningful distinction made between what is untrue and equally untrue.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here there are no degrees, and no beliefs that what does not exist is truer in some forms than others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All of them are false, and can be cured because they are not true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>So do we lay aside our amulets, our charms and medicines, our chants and bits of magic in whatever form they take.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will be still and listen for the Voice of healing, which will cure all ills as one, restoring saneness to the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No voice but this can cure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Today we hear a single Voice which speaks to us of truth, where all illusions end, and peace returns to the eternal, quiet home of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We waken hearing Him, and let Him speak to us five minutes as the day begins, and end the day by listening again five minutes more before we go to sleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Our only preparation is to let our interfering thoughts be laid aside, not separately, but all of them as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We have no need to make them different, and thus delay the time when we can hear our Father speak to us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We hear Him now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We come to Him today.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"545#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>With nothing in our hands to which we cling, with lifted hearts and listening minds we pray:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"545#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only salvation can be said to cure.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Speak to us, Father, that we may be healed.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"545#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And we will feel salvation cover us with soft protection, and with peace so deep that no illusion can disturb our minds, nor offer proof to us that it is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This will we learn today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And we will say our prayer for healing hourly, and take a minute as the hour strikes, to hear the answer to our prayer be given us as we attend in silence and in joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the day when healing comes to us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"545#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is the day when separation ends, and we remember Who we really are.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"“Cure” is a word that cannot be applied to any remedy the world
