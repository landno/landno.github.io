data-sentence-id=\"321#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God asks for nothing, and His Son, like Him, need ask for nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For there is no lack in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>An empty space, a little gap, would be a lack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it is only there that he could want for something he has not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A space where God is not, a gap between the Father and the Son is not the Will of Either, Who have promised to be one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God’s promise is a promise to Himself, and there is no one who could be untrue to what He wills as part of what He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The promise that there is no gap between Himself and what He is cannot be false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What will can come between what must be one, and in Whose Wholeness there can be no gap?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"321#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The beautiful relationship you have with all your brothers is a part of you because it is a part of God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Are you not sick, if you deny yourself your wholeness and your health, the Source of help, the Call to healing and the Call to heal?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your savior waits for healing, and the world waits with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor are you apart from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For healing will be one or not at all, its oneness being where the healing is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What could correct for separation but its opposite?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no middle ground in any aspect of salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You accept it wholly or accept it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What is unseparated must be joined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And what is joined cannot be separate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"321#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Either there is a gap between you and your brother, or you are as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no in between, no other choice, and no allegiance to be split between the two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A split allegiance is but faithlessness to both, and merely sets you spinning round, to grasp uncertainly at any straw that seems to hold some promise of relief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet who can build his home upon a straw, and count on it as shelter from the wind?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The body can be made a home like this, because it lacks foundation in the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And yet, because it does, it can be seen as not your home, but merely as an aid to help you reach the home where God abides.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"321#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>With <i>this</i> as purpose is the body healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not used to witness to the dream of separation and disease.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor is it idly blamed for what it did not do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It serves to help the healing of God’s Son, and for this purpose it cannot be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It will not join a purpose not your own, and you have chosen that it not be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All miracles are based upon this choice, and given you the instant it is made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No forms of sickness are immune, because the choice cannot be made in terms of form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The choice of sickness seems to be of form, yet it is one, as is its opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And you are sick or well, accordingly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"321#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But never you alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This world is but the dream that you can be alone, and think without affecting those apart from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To be alone must mean you are apart, and if you are, you cannot but be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This seems to prove that you must be apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet all it means is that you tried to keep a promise to be true to faithlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet faithlessness is sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is like the house set upon straw.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It seems to be quite solid and substantial in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet its stability cannot be judged apart from its foundation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If it rests on straw, there is no need to bar the door and lock the windows and make fast the bolts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The wind will topple it, and rain will come and carry it into oblivion.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"321#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is the sense in seeking to be safe in what was made for danger and for fear?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Why burden it with further locks and chains and heavy anchors, when its weakness lies, not in itself, but in the frailty of the little gap of nothingness whereon it stands?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What can be safe that rests upon a shadow?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would you build your home upon what will collapse beneath a feather’s weight?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"321#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your home is built upon your brother’s health, upon his happiness, his sinlessness, and everything his Father promised him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No secret promise you have made instead has shaken the Foundation of his home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The winds will blow upon it and the rain will beat against it, but with no effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The world will wash away and yet this house will stand forever, for its strength lies not within itself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is an ark of safety, resting on God’s promise that His Son is safe forever in Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What gap can interpose itself between the safety of this shelter and its Source?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>From here the body can be seen as what it is, and neither less nor more in worth than the extent to which it can be used to liberate God’s Son unto his home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"321#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And with this holy purpose is it made a home of holiness a little while, because it shares your Father’s Will with you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"God asks for
