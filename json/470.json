class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today‚Äôs idea is a complete and accurate statement of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is why you are the light of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is why God appointed you as the world‚Äôs savior.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is why the Son of God looks to you for his salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is saved by what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We will make every effort today to reach this truth about you, and to realize fully, if only for a moment, that it is the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"470#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the longer practice period, we will think about your reality and its wholly unchanged and unchangeable nature.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will begin by repeating this truth about you, and then spend a few minutes adding some relevant thoughts, such as:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"470#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Holiness created me holy.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Kindness created me kind.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Helpfulness created me helpful.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perfection created me perfect.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"470#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Any attribute which is in accord with God as He defines Himself is appropriate for use.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>We are trying today to undo your definition of God and replace it with His Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>We are also trying to emphasize that you are part of His definition of Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"470#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>After you have gone over several such related thoughts, try to let all thoughts drop away for a brief preparatory interval, and then try to reach past all your images and preconceptions about yourself to the truth in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If love created you like itself, this Self must be in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And somewhere in your mind It is there for you to find.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"470#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may find it necessary to repeat the idea for today from time to time to replace distracting thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may also find that this is not sufficient, and that you need to continue adding other thoughts related to the truth about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet perhaps you will succeed in going past that, and through the interval of thoughtlessness to the awareness of a blazing light in which you recognize yourself as love created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Be confident that you will do much today to bring that awareness nearer, whether you feel you have succeeded or not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"470#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It will be particularly helpful today to practice the idea for the day as often as you can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You need to hear the truth about yourself as frequently as possible, because your mind is so preoccupied with false self-images.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Four or five times an hour, and perhaps even more, it would be most beneficial to remind yourself that love created you like itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Hear the truth about yourself in this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"470#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Try to realize in the shorter practice periods that this is not your tiny, solitary voice that tells you this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the Voice for God, reminding you of your Father and of your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the Voice of truth, replacing everything that the ego tells you about yourself with the simple truth about the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"470#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You were created by love like itself.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today‚Äôs idea is a complete and accurate statement of what you are.
