<span data-sentence-id=\"235#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We said that peace must first surmount the obstacle of your desire to get rid of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Where the attraction of guilt holds sway, peace is not wanted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The second obstacle that peace must flow across, and closely related to the first, is the belief that the body is valuable for what it offers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For here is the attraction of guilt made manifest in the body, and seen in it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"235#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the value that you think peace would rob you of.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is what you believe that it would dispossess, and leave you homeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And it is this for which you would deny a home to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This “sacrifice” you feel to be too great to make, too much to ask of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is it a sacrifice, or a release?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What has the body really given you that justifies your strange belief that in it lies salvation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do you not see that this is the belief in death?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Here is the focus of the perception of Atonement as murder.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Here is the source of the idea that love is fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"235#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s messengers are sent far beyond the body, calling the mind to join in holy communion and be at peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Such is the message that I gave them for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is only the messengers of fear that see the body, for they look for what can suffer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is it a sacrifice to be removed from what can suffer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit does not demand you sacrifice the hope of the body’s pleasure; it <i>has</i> no hope of pleasure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But neither can it bring you fear of pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Pain is the only “sacrifice” the Holy Spirit asks, and this He <i>would</i> remove.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"235#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Peace is extended from you only to the eternal, and it reaches out from the eternal in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It flows across all else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The second obstacle is no more solid than the first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you want neither to get rid of peace nor limit it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What are these obstacles that you would interpose between peace and its going forth but barriers you place between your will and its accomplishment?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You want communion, not the feast of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You want salvation, not the pain of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you want your Father, not a little mound of clay, to be your home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>In your holy relationship is your Father’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He has not lost communion with Him, nor with himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>When you agreed to join your brother, you acknowledged this is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>This has no cost, but it has release from cost.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"235#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have paid very dearly for your illusions, and nothing you have paid for brought you peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Are you not glad that Heaven cannot be sacrificed, and sacrifice cannot be asked of you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no obstacle that you can place before our union, for in your holy relationship I am there already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We will surmount all obstacles together, for we stand within the gates and not outside.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How easily the gates are opened from within, to let peace through to bless the tired world!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can it be difficult for us to walk past barriers together, when you have joined the limitless?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The end of guilt is in your hands to give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Would you stop now to look for guilt in your brother?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"235#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let me be to you the symbol of the end of guilt, and look upon your brother as you would look on me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Forgive me all the sins you think the Son of God committed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And in the light of your forgiveness he will remember who he is, and forget what never was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I ask for your forgiveness, for if you are guilty, so must I be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But if I surmounted guilt and overcame the world, you were with me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Would you see in me the symbol of guilt or of the end of guilt, remembering that what I signify to you you see within yourself?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"235#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>From your holy relationship truth proclaims the truth, and love looks on itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Salvation flows from deep within the home you offered to my Father and to me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And we are there together, in the quiet communion in which the Father and the Son are joined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>O come ye faithful to the holy union of the Father and the Son in you!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And keep you not apart from what is offered you in gratitude for giving peace its home in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Send forth to all the world the joyous message of the end of guilt, and all the world will answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Think of your happiness as everyone offers you witness of the end of sin, and shows you that its power is gone forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Where can guilt be, when the belief in sin is gone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And where is death, when its great advocate is heard no more?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"235#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgive me your illusions, and release me from punishment for what I have not done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So will you learn the freedom that I taught by teaching freedom to your brother, and so releasing me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I am within your holy relationship, yet you would imprison me behind the obstacles you raise to freedom, and bar my way to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it is not possible to keep away One Who is there already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"235#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And in Him it <i>is</i> possible that our communion, where we are joined already, will be the focus of the new perception that will bring light to all the world, contained in you.</span></p></div>
