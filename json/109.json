data-sentence-id=\"109#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit teaches one lesson, and applies it to all individuals in all situations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Being conflict-free, He maximizes all efforts and all results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By teaching the power of the Kingdom of God Himself, He teaches you that all power is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its application does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is always maximal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your vigilance does not establish it as yours, but it does enable you to use it always and in all ways.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When I said “I am with you always,” I meant it literally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I am not absent to anyone in any situation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Because I am always with you, <i>you</i> are the way, the truth and the life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You did not make this power, any more than I did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It was created to be shared, and therefore cannot be meaningfully perceived as belonging to anyone at the expense of another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Such a perception makes it meaningless by eliminating or overlooking its real and only meaning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"109#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s meaning waits in the Kingdom, because that is where He placed it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not wait in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It merely rests in the Kingdom because it belongs there, as you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How can you who are God’s meaning perceive yourself as absent from it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can see yourself as separated from your meaning only by experiencing yourself as unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is why the ego is insane; it teaches that you are not what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is so contradictory it is clearly impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is therefore a lesson you cannot really learn, and therefore cannot really teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet you are always teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You must, therefore, be teaching something else, even though the ego does not know what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The ego, then, is always being undone, and does suspect your motives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Your mind cannot be unified in allegiance to the ego, because the mind does not belong to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Yet what is “treacherous” to the ego is faithful to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#2:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>The ego’s “enemy” is therefore your friend.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"109#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I said before that the ego’s friend is not part of you, because the ego perceives itself at war and therefore in need of allies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You who are not at war must look for brothers and recognize all whom you see as brothers, because only equals are at peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Because God’s equal Sons have everything, they cannot compete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet if they perceive any of their brothers as anything other than their perfect equals, the idea of competition has entered their minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not underestimate your need to be vigilant <i>against</i> this idea, because all your conflicts come from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It <i>is</i> the belief that conflicting interests are possible, and therefore you have accepted the impossible as true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Is that different from saying you perceive yourself as unreal?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"109#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To be in the Kingdom is merely to focus your full attention on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As long as you believe you can attend to what is not true, you are accepting conflict as your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is it really a choice?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It seems to be, but seeming and reality are hardly the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You who <i>are</i> the Kingdom are not concerned with seeming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Reality is yours because you are reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is how <i>having</i> and <i>being</i> are ultimately reconciled, not in the Kingdom, but in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The altar there is the only reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The altar is perfectly clear in thought, because it is a reflection of perfect Thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Your right mind sees only brothers, because it sees only in its own light.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"109#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God has lit your mind Himself, and keeps your mind lit by His light because His light is what your mind is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is totally beyond question, and when you question it you are answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Answer merely undoes the question by establishing the fact that to question reality is to question meaninglessly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is why the Holy Spirit never questions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His sole function is to undo the questionable and thus lead to certainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The certain are perfectly calm, because they are not in doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They do not raise questions, because nothing questionable enters their minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"109#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This holds them in perfect serenity, because this is what they share, knowing what they are.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The Holy Spirit teaches one lesson, and applies it to all individuals in all situations.
