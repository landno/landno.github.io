5"},"annotation":"W-5","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text lesson-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"407#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This idea, like the preceding one, can be used with any person, situation or event you think is causing you pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Apply it specifically to whatever you believe is the cause of your upset, using the description of the feeling in whatever term seems accurate to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The upset may seem to be fear, worry, depression, anxiety, anger, hatred, jealousy or any number of forms, all of which will be perceived as different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>However, until you learn that form does not matter, each form becomes a proper subject for the exercises for the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Applying the same idea to each of them separately is the first step in ultimately recognizing they are all the same.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"407#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When using the idea for today for a specific perceived cause of an upset in any form, use both the name of the form in which you see the upset, and the cause which you ascribe to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For example:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"407#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I am not angry at _________ for the reason I think.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am not afraid of _________ for the reason I think.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"407#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But again, this should not be substituted for practice periods in which you first search your mind for ‚Äúsources‚Äù of upset in which you believe, and forms of upset which you think result.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"407#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In these exercises, more than in the preceding ones, you may find it hard to be indiscriminate, and to avoid giving greater weight to some subjects than to others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It might help to precede the exercises with the statement:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"407#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There are no small upsets.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are all equally disturbing to my peace of mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"407#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Then examine your mind for whatever is distressing you, regardless of how much or how little you think it is doing so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"407#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may also find yourself less willing to apply today‚Äôs idea to some perceived sources of upset than to others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If this occurs, think first of this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"407#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I cannot keep this form of upset and let the others go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the purposes of these exercises, then, I will regard them all as the same.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"407#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Then search your mind for no more than a minute or so, and try to identify a number of different forms of upset that are disturbing you, regardless of the relative importance you may give them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Apply the idea for today to each of them, using the name of both the source of the upset as you perceive it, and of the feeling as you experience it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Further examples are:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"407#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am not worried about _________ for the reason I think.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I am not depressed about _________ for the reason I think.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"407#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Three or four times during the day is enough.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"This idea, like the preceding
