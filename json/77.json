data-sentence-id=\"077#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every system of thought must have a starting point.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It begins with either a making or a creating, a difference we have already discussed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Their resemblance lies in their power as foundations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Their difference lies in what rests upon them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Both are cornerstones for systems of belief by which one lives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is a mistake to believe that a thought system based on lies is weak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing made by a child of God is without power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is essential to realize this, because otherwise you will be unable to escape from the prison you have made.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"077#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot resolve the authority problem by depreciating the power of your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To do so is to deceive yourself, and this will hurt you because you really understand the strength of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You also realize that you cannot weaken it, any more than you can weaken God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The “devil” is a frightening concept because he seems to be extremely powerful and extremely active.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is perceived as a force in combat with God, battling Him for possession of His creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The devil deceives by lies, and builds kingdoms in which everything is in direct opposition to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet he attracts men rather than repels them, and they are willing to “sell” him their souls in return for gifts of no real worth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This makes absolutely no sense.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"077#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have discussed the fall or separation before, but its meaning must be clearly understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The separation is a system of thought real enough in time, though not in eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All beliefs are real to the believer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The fruit of only one tree was “forbidden” in the symbolic garden.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But God could not have forbidden it, or it could not have <i>been</i> eaten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If God knows His children, and I assure you that He does, would He have put them in a position where their own destruction was possible?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The “forbidden tree” was named the “tree of knowledge.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet God created knowledge and gave it freely to His creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The symbolism here has been given many interpretations, but you may be sure that any interpretation that sees either God or His creations as capable of destroying Their Own purpose is in error.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"077#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is a symbolic expression for usurping the ability for self-creating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the only sense in which God and His creations are not co-creators.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The belief that they are is implicit in the “self-concept,” or the tendency of the self to make an image of itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Images are perceived, not known.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Knowledge cannot deceive, but perception can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can perceive yourself as self-creating, but you cannot do more than believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You cannot make it true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And, as I said before, when you finally perceive correctly you can only be glad that you cannot.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Until then, however, the belief that you can is the foundation stone in your thought system, and all your defenses are used to attack ideas that might bring it to light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You still believe you are an image of your own making.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Your mind is split with the Holy Spirit on this point, and there is no resolution while you believe the one thing that is literally inconceivable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>That is why you cannot create and are filled with fear about what you make.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"077#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The mind can make the belief in separation very real and very fearful, and this belief <i>is</i> the “devil.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is powerful, active, destructive and clearly in opposition to God, because it literally denies His Fatherhood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Look at your life and see what the devil has made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But realize that this making will surely dissolve in the light of truth, because its foundation is a lie.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your creation by God is the only Foundation that cannot be shaken, because the light is in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your starting point is truth, and you must return to your Beginning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Much has been seen since then, but nothing has really happened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your Self is still in peace, even though your mind is in conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You have not yet gone back far enough, and that is why you become so fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>As you approach the Beginning, you feel the fear of the destruction of your thought system upon you as if it were the fear of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>There is no death, but there <i>is</i> a belief in death.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"077#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The branch that bears no fruit will be cut off and will wither away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be glad!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The light will shine from the true Foundation of life, and your own thought system will stand corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It cannot stand otherwise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You who fear salvation are choosing death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Life and death, light and darkness, knowledge and perception, are irreconcilable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To believe that they can be reconciled is to believe that God and His Son can <i>not.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Only the oneness of knowledge is free of conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your Kingdom is not of this world because it was given you from beyond this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Only in this world is the idea of an authority problem meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"077#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The world is not left by death but by truth, and truth can be known by all those for whom the Kingdom was created, and for whom it waits.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Every system of thought must have a starting point.
