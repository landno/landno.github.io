class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The importance of this idea lies in the fact that it contains a correction for a major perceptual distortion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You think that what upsets you is a frightening world, or a sad world, or a violent world, or an insane world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All these attributes are given it by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The world is meaningless in itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"414#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These exercises are done with eyes open.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Look around you, this time quite slowly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Try to pace yourself so that the slow shifting of your glance from one thing to another involves a fairly constant time interval.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not allow the time of the shift to become markedly longer or shorter, but try, instead, to keep a measured, even tempo throughout.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you see does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You teach yourself this as you give whatever your glance rests on equal attention and equal time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is a beginning step in learning to give them all equal value.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"414#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As you look about you, say to yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"414#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I think I see a fearful world, a dangerous world, a hostile world, a sad world, a wicked world, a crazy world,</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"414#3:2\">and so on, using whatever descriptive terms happen to occur to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If terms which seem positive rather than negative occur to you, include them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For example, you might think of ‚Äúa good world,‚Äù or ‚Äúa satisfying world.‚Äù</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If such terms occur to you, use them along with the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You may not yet understand why these ‚Äúnice‚Äù adjectives belong in these exercises but remember that a ‚Äúgood world‚Äù implies a ‚Äúbad‚Äù one, and a ‚Äúsatisfying world‚Äù implies an ‚Äúunsatisfying‚Äù one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All terms which cross your mind are suitable subjects for today‚Äôs exercises.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Their seeming quality does not matter.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"414#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be sure that you do not alter the time intervals between applying today‚Äôs idea to what you think is pleasant and what you think is unpleasant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the purposes of these exercises, there is no difference between them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>At the end of the practice period, add:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"414#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But I am upset because I see a meaningless world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"414#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is meaningless is neither good nor bad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Why, then, should a meaningless world upset you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you could accept the world as meaningless and let the truth be written upon it for you, it would make you indescribably happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But because it is meaningless, you are impelled to write upon it what you would have it be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this you see in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is this that is meaningless in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Beneath your words is written the Word of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The truth upsets you now, but when your words have been erased, you will see His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That is the ultimate purpose of these exercises.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"414#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Three or four times is enough for practicing the idea for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor should the practice periods exceed a minute.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You may find even this too long.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"414#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Terminate the exercises whenever you experience a sense of strain.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The importance of this idea lies in the fact that it contains a correction for a major perceptual distortion.
