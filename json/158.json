data-sentence-id=\"158#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is certain that love is dangerous, and this is always its central teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It never puts it this way; on the contrary, everyone who believes that the ego is salvation seems to be intensely engaged in the search for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet the ego, though encouraging the search for love very actively, makes one proviso; do not find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its dictates, then, can be summed up simply as: “Seek and do <i>not</i> find.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the one promise the ego holds out to you, and the one promise it will keep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the ego pursues its goal with fanatic insistence, and its judgment, though severely impaired, is completely consistent.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"158#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The search the ego undertakes is therefore bound to be defeated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And since it also teaches that it is your identification, its guidance leads you to a journey which must end in perceived self-defeat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the ego cannot love, and in its frantic search for love it is seeking what it is afraid to find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The search is inevitable because the ego is part of your mind, and because of its source the ego is not wholly split off, or it could not be believed at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it is your mind that believes in it and gives existence to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it is also your mind that has the power to deny the ego’s existence, and you will surely do so when you realize exactly what the journey is on which the ego sets you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"158#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is surely obvious that no one wants to find what would utterly defeat him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Being unable to love, the ego would be totally inadequate in love’s presence, for it could not respond at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then, you would have to abandon the ego’s guidance, for it would be quite apparent that it had not taught you the response you need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego will therefore distort love, and teach you that love really calls forth the responses the ego <i>can</i> teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Follow its teaching, then, and you will search for love, but will not recognize it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"158#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do you realize that the ego must set you on a journey which cannot but lead to a sense of futility and depression?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To seek and not to find is hardly joyous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is this the promise you would keep?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit offers you another promise, and one that will lead to joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For His promise is always, “Seek and you <i>will</i> find,” and under His guidance you cannot be defeated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His is the journey to accomplishment, and the goal He sets before you He will give you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For He will never deceive God’s Son whom He loves with the Love of the Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"158#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You <i>will</i> undertake a journey because you are not at home in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you <i>will</i> search for your home whether you realize where it is or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you believe it is outside you the search will be futile, for you will be seeking it where it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do not remember how to look within for you do not believe your home is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the Holy Spirit remembers it for you, and He will guide you to your home because that is His mission.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As He fulfills His mission He will teach you yours, for your mission is the same as His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>By guiding your brothers home you are but following Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"158#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Behold the Guide your Father gave you, that you might learn you have eternal life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For death is not your Father’s Will nor yours, and whatever is true is the Will of the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You pay no price for life for that was given you, but you do pay a price for death, and a very heavy one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If death is your treasure, you will sell everything else to purchase it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you will believe that you have purchased it, because you have sold everything else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet you cannot sell the Kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your inheritance can neither be bought nor sold.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There can be no disinherited parts of the Sonship, for God is whole and all His extensions are like Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"158#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Atonement is not the price of your wholeness, but it <i>is</i> the price of your awareness of your wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For what you chose to “sell” had to be kept for you, since you could not “buy” it back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you must invest in it, not with money but with spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For spirit is will, and will is the “price” of the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your inheritance awaits only the recognition that you have been redeemed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"158#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit guides you into life eternal, but you must relinquish your investment in death, or you will not see life though it is all around you.</span></p></div>
