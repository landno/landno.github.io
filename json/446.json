class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we are continuing the idea for yesterday, adding another dimension to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot see in darkness, and you cannot make light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can make darkness and then think you see in it, but light reflects life, and is therefore an aspect of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Creation and darkness cannot coexist, but light and life must go together, being but different aspects of creation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In order to see, you must recognize that light is within, not without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not see outside yourself, nor is the equipment for seeing outside you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>An essential part of this equipment is the light that makes seeing possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is with you always, making vision possible in every circumstance.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we are going to attempt to reach that light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this purpose, we will use a form of exercise which has been suggested before, and which we will utilize increasingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a particularly difficult form for the undisciplined mind, and represents a major goal of mind training.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It requires precisely what the untrained mind lacks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet this training must be accomplished if you are to see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Have at least three practice periods today, each lasting three to five minutes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A longer time is highly recommended, but only if you find the time slipping by with little or no sense of strain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The form of practice we will use today is the most natural and easy one in the world for the trained mind, just as it seems to be the most unnatural and difficult for the untrained mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your mind is no longer wholly untrained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are quite ready to learn the form of exercise we will use today, but you may find that you will encounter strong resistance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The reason is very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>While you practice in this way, you leave behind everything that you now believe, and all the thoughts that you have made up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Properly speaking, this is the release from hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet perceived through the ego‚Äôs eyes, it is loss of identity and a descent into hell.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you can stand aside from the ego by ever so little, you will have no difficulty in recognizing that its opposition and its fears are meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You might find it helpful to remind yourself, from time to time, that to reach light is to escape from darkness, whatever you may believe to the contrary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God is the light in which you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are attempting to reach Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin the practice period by repeating today‚Äôs idea with your eyes open, and close them slowly, repeating the idea several times more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Then try to sink into your mind, letting go every kind of interference and intrusion by quietly sinking past them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your mind cannot be stopped in this unless you choose to stop it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is merely taking its natural course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Try to observe your passing thoughts without involvement, and slip quietly by them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>While no particular approach is advocated for this form of exercise, what is needful is a sense of the importance of what you are doing; its inestimable value to you, and an awareness that you are attempting something very holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Salvation is your happiest accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is also the only one that has any meaning, because it is the only one that has any real use to you at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If resistance rises in any form, pause long enough to repeat today‚Äôs idea, keeping your eyes closed unless you are aware of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In that case, you will probably find it more reassuring to open your eyes briefly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Try, however, to return to the exercises with eyes closed as soon as possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are doing the exercises correctly, you should experience some sense of relaxation, and even a feeling that you are approaching, if not actually entering into light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try to think of light, formless and without limit, as you pass by the thoughts of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And do not forget that they cannot hold you to the world unless you give them the power to do so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"446#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Throughout the day repeat the idea often, with eyes open or closed as seems better to you at the time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But do not forget.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"446#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Above all, be determined not to forget today.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today we are continuing the idea
