data-sentence-id=\"329#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Seek not outside yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it will fail, and you will weep each time an idol falls.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Heaven cannot be found where it is not, and there can be no peace excepting there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each idol that you worship when God calls will never answer in His place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no other answer you can substitute, and find the happiness His answer brings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Seek not outside yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For all your pain comes simply from a futile search for what you want, insisting where it must be found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What if it is not there?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Do you prefer that you be right or happy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Be you glad that you are told where happiness abides, and seek no longer elsewhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You will fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>But it is given you to know the truth, and not to seek for it outside yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"329#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one who comes here but must still have hope, some lingering illusion, or some dream that there is something outside of himself that will bring happiness and peace to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If everything is in him this cannot be so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And therefore by his coming, he denies the truth about himself, and seeks for something more than everything, as if a part of it were separated off and found where all the rest of it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the purpose he bestows upon the body; that it seek for what he lacks, and give him what would make himself complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus he wanders aimlessly about, in search of something that he cannot find, believing that he is what he is not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"329#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The lingering illusion will impel him to seek out a thousand idols, and to seek beyond them for a thousand more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And each will fail him, all excepting one; for he will die, and does not understand the idol that he seeks <i>is</i> but his death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its form appears to be outside himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet does he seek to kill God’s Son within, and prove that he is victor over him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the purpose every idol has, for this the role that is assigned to it, and this the role that cannot be fulfilled.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"329#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you attempt to reach a goal in which the body’s betterment is cast as major beneficiary, you try to bring about your death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you believe that you can suffer lack, and lack <i>is</i> death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To sacrifice is to give up, and thus to be without and to have suffered loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And by this giving up is life renounced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Seek not outside yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The search implies you are not whole within and fear to look upon your devastation, but prefer to seek outside yourself for what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"329#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Idols must fall <i>because</i> they have no life, and what is lifeless is a sign of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You came to die, and what would you expect but to perceive the signs of death you seek?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No sadness and no suffering proclaim a message other than an idol found that represents a parody of life which, in its lifelessness, is really death, conceived as real and given living form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet each must fail and crumble and decay, because a form of death cannot be life, and what is sacrificed cannot be whole.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"329#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All idols of this world were made to keep the truth within from being known to you, and to maintain allegiance to the dream that you must find what is outside yourself to be complete and happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is vain to worship idols in the hope of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God dwells within, and your completion lies in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No idol takes His place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Look not to idols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not seek outside yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"329#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us forget the purpose of the world the past has given it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For otherwise, the future will be like the past, and but a series of depressing dreams, in which all idols fail you, one by one, and you see death and disappointment everywhere.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"329#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To change all this, and open up a road of hope and of release in what appeared to be an endless circle of despair, you need but to decide you do not know the purpose of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You give it goals it does not have, and thus do you decide what it is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You try to see in it a place of idols found outside yourself, with power to make complete what is within by splitting what you are between the two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You choose your dreams, for they are what you wish, perceived as if it had been given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your idols do what you would have them do, and have the power you ascribe to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you pursue them vainly in the dream, because you want their power as your own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"329#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet where are dreams but in a mind asleep?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And can a dream succeed in making real the picture it projects outside itself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Save time, my brother; learn what time is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And speed the end of idols in a world made sad and sick by seeing idols there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your holy mind is altar unto God, and where He is no idols can abide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The fear of God is but the fear of loss of idols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is not the fear of loss of your reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But you have made of your reality an idol, which you must protect against the light of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And all the world becomes the means by which this idol can be saved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Salvation thus appears to threaten life and offer death.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"329#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Salvation seeks to prove there is no death, and only life exists.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The sacrifice of death is nothing lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>An idol cannot take the place of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let Him remind you of His Love for you, and do not seek to drown His Voice in chants of deep despair to idols of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Seek not outside your Father for your hope.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"329#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For hope of happiness is <i>not</i> despair.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Seek not outside yourself.
