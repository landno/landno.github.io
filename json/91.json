data-sentence-id=\"091#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The way to recognize your brother is by recognizing the Holy Spirit in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I have already said that the Holy Spirit is the Bridge for the transfer of perception to knowledge, so we can use the terms as if they were related, because in His Mind they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This relationship must be in His Mind because, unless it were, the separation between the two ways of thinking would not be open to healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He is part of the Holy Trinity, because His Mind is partly yours and also partly God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This needs clarification, not in statement but in experience.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is the idea of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Being thought, the idea gains as it is shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Being the Call <i>for</i> God, it is also the idea <i>of</i> God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Since you are part of God it is also the idea of yourself, as well as of all His creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The idea of the Holy Spirit shares the property of other ideas because it follows the laws of the universe of which it is a part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is strengthened by being given away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It increases in you as you give it to your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your brother does not have to be aware of the Holy Spirit in himself or in you for this miracle to occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He may have dissociated the Call for God, just as you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This dissociation is healed in both of you as you become aware of the Call for God in him, and thus acknowledge Its being.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There are two diametrically opposed ways of seeing your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They must both be in your mind, because you are the perceiver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They must also be in his, because you are perceiving him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>See him through the Holy Spirit in his mind, and you will recognize Him in yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you acknowledge in your brother you are acknowledging in yourself, and what you share you strengthen.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Voice of the Holy Spirit is weak in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is why you must share It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It must be increased in strength before you can hear It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is impossible to hear It in yourself while It is so weak in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not weak in Itself, but It is limited by your unwillingness to hear It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you make the mistake of looking for the Holy Spirit in yourself alone your thoughts will frighten you because, by adopting the ego’s viewpoint, you are undertaking an ego-alien journey with the ego as guide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is bound to produce fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Delay is of the ego, because time is its concept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Both time and delay are meaningless in eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have said before that the Holy Spirit is God’s Answer to the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everything of which the Holy Spirit reminds you is in direct opposition to the ego’s notions, because true and false perceptions are themselves opposed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit has the task of undoing what the ego has made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He undoes it at the same level on which the ego operates, or the mind would be unable to understand the change.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have repeatedly emphasized that one level of the mind is not understandable to another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So it is with the ego and the Holy Spirit; with time and eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Eternity is an idea of God, so the Holy Spirit understands it perfectly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Time is a belief of the ego, so the lower mind, which is the ego’s domain, accepts it without question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The only aspect of time that is eternal is <i>now.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is the Mediator between the interpretations of the ego and the knowledge of the spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His ability to deal with symbols enables Him to work with the ego’s beliefs in its own language.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His ability to look beyond symbols into eternity enables Him to understand the laws of God, for which He speaks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He can therefore perform the function of reinterpreting what the ego makes, not by destruction but by understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Understanding is light, and light leads to knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit is in light because He is in you who are light, but you yourself do not know this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is therefore the task of the Holy Spirit to reinterpret you on behalf of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot understand yourself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is because you have no meaning apart from your rightful place in the Sonship, and the rightful place of the Sonship is God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is your life, your eternity and your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is of this that the Holy Spirit reminds you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this that the Holy Spirit sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This vision frightens the ego because it is so calm.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Peace is the ego’s greatest enemy because, according to its interpretation of reality, war is the guarantee of its survival.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego becomes strong in strife.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If you believe there is strife you will react viciously, because the idea of danger has entered your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The idea itself is an appeal to the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The Holy Spirit is as vigilant as the ego to the call of danger, opposing it with His strength just as the ego welcomes it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The Holy Spirit counters this welcome by welcoming peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Eternity and peace are as closely related as are time and war.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perception derives meaning from relationships.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Those you accept are the foundations of your beliefs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The separation is merely another term for a split mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego is the symbol of separation, just as the Holy Spirit is the symbol of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you perceive in others you are strengthening in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You may let your mind misperceive, but the Holy Spirit lets your mind reinterpret its own misperceptions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is the perfect Teacher.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He uses only what your mind already understands to teach you that you do not understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit can deal with a reluctant learner without going counter to his mind, because part of it is still for God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Despite the ego’s attempts to conceal this part, it is still much stronger than the ego, although the ego does not recognize it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit recognizes it perfectly because it is His Own dwelling place; the place in the mind where He is at home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are at home there, too, because it is a place of peace, and peace is of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You who are part of God are not at home except in His peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If peace is eternal, you are at home only in eternity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"091#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego made the world as it perceives it, but the Holy Spirit, the reinterpreter of what the ego made, sees the world as a teaching device for bringing you home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit must perceive time, and reinterpret it into the timeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He must work through opposites, because He must work with and for a mind that is in opposition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Correct and learn, and be open to learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have not made truth, but truth can still set you free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Look as the Holy Spirit looks, and understand as He understands.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His understanding looks back to God in remembrance of me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is in communion with God always, and He is part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He is your Guide to salvation, because He holds the remembrance of things past and to come, and brings them to the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"091#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He holds this gladness gently in your mind, asking only that you increase it in His Name by sharing it to increase His joy in you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The way to recognize your brother is by
