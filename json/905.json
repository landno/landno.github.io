its interpretation of progress and growth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"905#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>These interpretations will be wrong of necessity, because they are delusional.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"905#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The changes the ego seeks to make are not really changes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"905#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are but deeper shadows, or perhaps different cloud patterns.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"905#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet what is made of nothingness cannot be called new or different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"905#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Illusions are illusions;
