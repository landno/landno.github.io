data-sentence-id=\"336#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Idols are quite specific.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But your will is universal, being limitless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so it has no form, nor is content for its expression in the terms of form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Idols are limits.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are the belief that there are forms that will bring happiness, and that, by limiting, is all attained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is as if you said, “I have no need of everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This little thing I want, and it will be as everything to me.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And this must fail to satisfy, because it is your will that everything be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Decide for idols and you ask for loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Decide for truth and everything is yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"336#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is not form you seek.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What form can be a substitute for God the Father’s Love?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What form can take the place of all the love in the Divinity of God the Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What idol can make two of what is one?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And can the limitless be limited?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not want an idol.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is not your will to have one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It will not bestow on you the gift you seek.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>When you decide upon the form of what you want, you lose the understanding of its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>So you see your will within the idol, thus reducing it to a specific form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet this could never be your will, because what shares in all creation cannot be content with small ideas and little things.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"336#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Behind the search for every idol lies the yearning for completion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Wholeness has no form because it is unlimited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To seek a special person or a thing to add to you to make yourself complete, can only mean that you believe some form is missing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And by finding this, you will achieve completion in a form you like.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the purpose of an idol; that you will not look beyond it, to the source of the belief that you are incomplete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only if you had sinned could this be so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For sin is the idea you are alone and separated off from what is whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And thus it would be necessary for the search for wholeness to be made beyond the boundaries of limits on yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"336#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It never is the idol that you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But what you think it offers you, you want indeed and have the right to ask for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor could it be possible it be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your will to be complete is but God’s Will, and this is given you by being His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God knows not form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He cannot answer you in terms that have no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And your will could not be satisfied with empty forms, made but to fill a gap that is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is not this you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Creation gives no separate person and no separate thing the power to complete the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What idol can be called upon to give the Son of God what he already has?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"336#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Completion is the <i>function</i> of God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He has no need to seek for it at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Beyond all idols stands his holy will to be but what he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For more than whole is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If there were change in him, if he could be reduced to any form and limited to what is not in him, he would not be as God created him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What idol can he need to be himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For can he give a part of him away?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What is not whole cannot make whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But what is really asked for cannot be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Your will <i>is</i> granted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Not in any form that would content you not, but in the whole completely lovely Thought God holds of you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"336#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing that God knows not exists.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what He knows exists forever, changelessly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For thoughts endure as long as does the mind that thought of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And in the Mind of God there is no ending, nor a time in which His Thoughts were absent or could suffer change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thoughts are not born and cannot die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They share the attributes of their creator, nor have they a separate life apart from his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The thoughts you think are in your mind, as you are in the Mind which thought of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so there are no separate parts in what exists within God’s Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is forever One, eternally united and at peace.</span></p></div> <div

data-sentence-id=\"336#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet all this means is that you are sometimes aware of them, and sometimes not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>An unremembered thought is born again to you when it returns to your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it did not die when you forgot it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It was always there, but you were unaware of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Thought God holds of you is perfectly unchanged by your forgetting.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It will always be exactly as it was before the time when you forgot, and will be just the same when you remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And it is the same within the interval when you forgot.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"336#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Thoughts of God are far beyond all change, and shine forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They await not birth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They wait for welcome and remembering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Thought God holds of you is like a star, unchangeable in an eternal sky.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>So high in Heaven is it set that those outside of Heaven know not it is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet still and white and lovely will it shine through all eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There was no time it was not there; no instant when its light grew dimmer or less perfect ever was.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"336#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span>

<span data-sentence-id=\"336#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its perfect purity does not depend on whether it is seen on earth or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The sky embraces it and softly holds it in its perfect place, which is as far from earth as earth from Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not the distance nor the time that keeps this star invisible to earth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But those who seek for idols cannot know the star is there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"336#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#10:1\"><span class=\"snr

world, the dreams of birth and death that here are dreamed, the myriad of forms that fear can take; quite undisturbed, the Thought God holds of you remains exactly as it always was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"336#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Surrounded by a stillness so complete no sound of battle comes remotely near, it rests in certainty and perfect peace.</span> <span
