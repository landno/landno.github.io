data-sentence-id=\"099#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Any split in mind must involve a rejection of part of it, and this <i>is</i> the belief in separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Wholeness of God, which is His peace, cannot be appreciated except by a whole mind that recognizes the Wholeness of God’s creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By this recognition it knows its Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Exclusion and separation are synonymous, as are separation and dissociation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We have said before that the separation was and is dissociation, and that once it occurs projection becomes its main defense, or the device that keeps it going.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The reason, however, may not be so obvious as you think.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What you project you disown, and therefore do not believe is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are excluding yourself by the very judgment that you are different from the one on whom you project.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Since you have also judged against what you project, you continue to attack it because you continue to keep it separated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By doing this unconsciously, you try to keep the fact that you attacked yourself out of awareness, and thus imagine that you have made yourself safe.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet projection will always hurt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It reinforces your belief in your own split mind, and its only purpose is to keep the separation going.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is solely a device of the ego to make you feel different from your brothers and separated from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego justifies this on the grounds that it makes you seem “better” than they are, thus obscuring your equality with them still further.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Projection and attack are inevitably related, because projection is always a means of justifying attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Anger without projection is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ego uses projection only to destroy your perception of both yourself and your brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The process begins by excluding something that exists in you but which you do not want, and leads directly to excluding you from your brothers.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have learned, however, that there <i>is</i> an alternative to projection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every ability of the ego has a better use, because its abilities are directed by the mind, which has a better Voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit extends and the ego projects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As their goals are opposed, so is the result.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit begins by perceiving you as perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Knowing this perfection is shared He recognizes it in others, thus strengthening it in both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Instead of anger this arouses love for both, because it establishes inclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perceiving equality, the Holy Spirit perceives equal needs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This invites Atonement automatically, because Atonement is the one need in this world that is universal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To perceive yourself this way is the only way in which you can find happiness in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is because it is the acknowledgment that you are not in this world, for the world <i>is</i> unhappy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How else can you find joy in a joyless place except by realizing that you are not there?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot be anywhere God did not put you, and God created you as part of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is both where you are and what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is completely unalterable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is total inclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot change it now or ever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is forever true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is not a belief, but a Fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Anything that God created is as true as He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Its truth lies only in its perfect inclusion in Him Who alone is perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>To deny this is to deny yourself and Him, since it is impossible to accept one without the other.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The perfect equality of the Holy Spirit’s perception is the reflection of the perfect equality of God’s knowing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego’s perception has no counterpart in God, but the Holy Spirit remains the Bridge between perception and knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By enabling you to use perception in a way that reflects knowledge, you will ultimately remember it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego would prefer to believe that this memory is impossible, yet it is <i>your</i> perception the Holy Spirit guides.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your perception will end where it began.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Everything meets in God, because everything was created by Him and in Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God created His Sons by extending His Thought, and retaining the extensions of His Thought in His Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All His Thoughts are thus perfectly united within themselves and with each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit enables you to perceive this wholeness <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God created you to create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You cannot extend His Kingdom until you know of its wholeness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thoughts begin in the mind of the thinker, from which they reach outward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is as true of God’s Thinking as it is of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Because your mind is split, you can perceive as well as think.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet perception cannot escape the basic laws of mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You perceive from your mind and project your perceptions outward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Although perception of any kind is unreal, you made it and the Holy Spirit can therefore use it well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He can inspire perception and lead it toward God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This convergence seems to be far in the future only because your mind is not in perfect alignment with the idea, and therefore does not want it now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit uses time, but does not believe in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Coming from God He uses everything for good, but He does not believe in what is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Since the Holy Spirit is in your mind, your mind can also believe only what is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit can speak only for this, because He speaks for God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He tells you to return your whole mind to God, because it has never left Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it has never left Him, you need only perceive it as it is to be returned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The full awareness of the Atonement, then, is the recognition that <i>the separation never occurred.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego cannot prevail against this because it is an explicit statement that the ego never occurred.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego can accept the idea that return is necessary because it can so easily make the idea seem difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the Holy Spirit tells you that even return is unnecessary, because what never happened cannot be difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>However, you can <i>make</i> the idea of return both necessary and difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it is surely clear that the perfect need nothing, and you cannot experience perfection as a difficult accomplishment, because that is what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the way in which you must perceive God’s creations, bringing all of your perceptions into the one line the Holy Spirit sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This line is the direct line of communication with God, and lets your mind converge with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no conflict anywhere in this perception, because it means that all perception is guided by the Holy Spirit, Whose Mind is fixed on God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Only the Holy Spirit can resolve conflict, because only the Holy Spirit is conflict-free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He perceives only what is true in your mind, and extends outward only to what is true in other minds.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The difference between the ego’s projection and the Holy Spirit’s extension is very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego projects to exclude, and therefore to deceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit extends by recognizing Himself in every mind, and thus perceives them as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing conflicts in this perception, because what the Holy Spirit perceives is all the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Wherever He looks He sees Himself, and because He is united He offers the whole Kingdom always.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the one message God gave to Him and for which He must speak, because that is what He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The peace of God lies in that message, and so the peace of God lies in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The great peace of the Kingdom shines in your mind forever, but it must shine outward to make you aware of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"099#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit was given you with perfect impartiality, and only by recognizing Him impartially can you recognize Him at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego is legion, but the Holy Spirit is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No darkness abides anywhere in the Kingdom, but your part is only to allow no darkness to abide in your own mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This alignment with light is unlimited, because it is in alignment with the light of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"099#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each of us is the light of the world, and by joining our minds in this light we proclaim the Kingdom of God together and as one.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Any split in mind must involve a rejection of part of it, and this is the belief in separation.
