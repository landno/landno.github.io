<span data-sentence-id=\"183#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The journey that we undertake together is the exchange of dark for light, of ignorance for understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothing you understand is fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is only in darkness and in ignorance that you perceive the frightening, and shrink away from it to further darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet it is only the hidden that can terrify, not for what it is, but for its hiddenness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The obscure is frightening because you do not understand its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you did, it would be clear and you would be no longer in the dark.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing has hidden value, for what is hidden cannot be shared, and so its value is unknown.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The hidden is kept apart, but value always lies in joint appreciation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What is concealed cannot be loved, and so it must be feared.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"183#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The quiet light in which the Holy Spirit dwells within you is merely perfect openness, in which nothing is hidden and therefore nothing is fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Attack will always yield to love if it is brought to love, not hidden from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no darkness that the light of love will not dispel, unless it is concealed from love’s beneficence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is kept apart from love cannot share its healing power, because it has been separated off and kept in darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The sentinels of darkness watch over it carefully, and you who made these guardians of illusion out of nothing are now afraid of them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"183#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you continue to give imagined power to these strange ideas of safety?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are neither safe nor unsafe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They do not protect; neither do they attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They do nothing at all, being nothing at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As guardians of darkness and of ignorance look to them only for fear, for what they keep obscure <i>is</i> fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But let them go, and what was fearful will be so no longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Without protection of obscurity only the light of love remains, for only this has meaning and can live in light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Everything else must disappear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"183#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Death yields to life simply because destruction is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The light of guiltlessness shines guilt away because, when they are brought together, the truth of one must make the falsity of its opposite perfectly clear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Keep not guilt and guiltlessness apart, for your belief that you can have them both is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All you have done by keeping them apart is lose their meaning by confusing them with each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so you do not realize that only one means anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The other is wholly without sense of any kind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"183#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have regarded the separation as a means for breaking your communication with your Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit reinterprets it as a means of re-establishing what was not broken, but <i>has</i> been made obscure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All things you made have use to Him, for His most holy purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He knows you are not separate from God, but He perceives much in your mind that lets you think you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All this and nothing else would He separate from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The power of decision, which you made in place of the power of creation, He would teach you how to use on your behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You who made it to crucify yourself must learn of Him how to apply it to the holy cause of restoration.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"183#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who speak in dark and devious symbols do not understand the language you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has no meaning, for its purpose is not communication, but rather the disruption of communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If the purpose of language is communication, how can this tongue mean anything?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet even this strange and twisted effort to communicate through not communicating holds enough of love to make it meaningful if its Interpreter is not its maker.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You who made it are but expressing conflict, from which the Holy Spirit would release you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Leave what you would communicate to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He will interpret it to you with perfect clarity, for He knows with Whom you are in perfect communication.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"183#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You know not what you say, and so you know not what is said to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet your Interpreter perceives the meaning in your alien language.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He will not attempt to communicate the meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But He will separate out all that has meaning, dropping off the rest and offering your true communication to those who would communicate as truly with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You speak two languages at once, and this must lead to unintelligibility.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet if one means nothing and the other everything, only that one is possible for purposes of communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The other but interferes with it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"183#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s function is entirely communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He therefore must remove whatever interferes with communication in order to restore it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, keep no source of interference from His sight, for He will not attack your sentinels.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But bring them to Him and let His gentleness teach you that, in the light, they are not fearful, and cannot serve to guard the dark doors behind which nothing at all is carefully concealed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We must open all doors and let the light come streaming through.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There are no hidden chambers in God’s temple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Its gates are open wide to greet His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"183#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No one can fail to come where God has called him, if he close not the door himself upon his Father’s welcome.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The journey that we undertake together is the exchange of dark for light, of ignorance for understanding.
