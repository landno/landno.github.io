class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today‚Äôs idea will eventually overcome completely the sense of loneliness and abandonment all the separated ones experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Depression is an inevitable consequence of separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>So are anxiety, worry, a deep sense of helplessness, misery, suffering and intense fear of loss.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"443#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The separated ones have invented many ‚Äúcures‚Äù for what they believe to be ‚Äúthe ills of the world.‚Äù</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But the one thing they do not do is to question the reality of the problem.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet its effects cannot be cured because the problem is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The idea for today has the power to end all this foolishness forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And foolishness it is, despite the serious and tragic forms it may take.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"443#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Deep within you is everything that is perfect, ready to radiate through you and out into the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It will cure all sorrow and pain and fear and loss because it will heal the mind that thought these things were real, and suffered out of its allegiance to them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"443#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can never be deprived of your perfect holiness because its Source goes with you wherever you go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can never suffer because the Source of all joy goes with you wherever you go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can never be alone because the Source of all life goes with you wherever you go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing can destroy your peace of mind because God goes with you wherever you go.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"443#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We understand that you do not believe all this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How could you, when the truth is hidden deep within, under a heavy cloud of insane thoughts, dense and obscuring, yet representing all you see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Today we will make our first real attempt to get past this dark and heavy cloud, and to go through it to the light beyond.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"443#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There will be only one long practice period today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the morning, as soon as you get up if possible, sit quietly for some three to five minutes, with your eyes closed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>At the beginning of the practice period, repeat today‚Äôs idea very slowly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then make no effort to think of anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Try, instead, to get a sense of turning inward, past all the idle thoughts of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Try to enter very deeply into your own mind, keeping it clear of any thoughts that might divert your attention.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"443#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>From time to time, you may repeat the idea if you find it helpful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But most of all, try to sink down and inward, away from the world and all the foolish thoughts of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are trying to reach past all these things.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are trying to leave appearances and approach reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"443#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is quite possible to reach God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In fact it is very easy, because it is the most natural thing in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You might even say it is the only natural thing in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The way will open, if you believe that it is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This exercise can bring very startling results even the first time it is attempted, and sooner or later it is always successful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We will go into more detail about this kind of practice as we go along.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But it will never fail completely, and instant success is possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"443#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Throughout the day use today‚Äôs idea often, repeating it very slowly, preferably with eyes closed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Think of what you are saying; what the words mean.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Concentrate on the holiness that they imply about you; on the unfailing companionship that is yours; on the complete protection that surrounds you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"443#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"443#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can indeed afford to laugh at fear thoughts, remembering that God goes with you wherever you go.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today‚Äôs idea will eventually overcome
