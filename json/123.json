data-sentence-id=\"123#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Can you be separated from your identification and be at peace?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Dissociation is not a solution; it is a delusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The delusional believe that truth will assail them, and they do not recognize it because they prefer the delusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Judging truth as something they do not want, they perceive their illusions which block knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Help them by offering them your unified mind on their behalf, as I am offering you mine on behalf of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Alone we can do nothing, but together our minds fuse into something whose power is far beyond the power of its separate parts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>By not being separate, the Mind of God is established in ours and as ours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This Mind is invincible because it is undivided.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"123#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The undivided will of the Sonship is the perfect creator, being wholly in the likeness of God, Whose Will it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot be exempt from it if you are to understand what it is and what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By the belief that your will is separate from mine, you are exempting yourself from the Will of God which <i>is</i> yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet to heal is still to make whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore, to heal is to unite with those who are like you, because perceiving this likeness is to recognize the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If your perfection is in Him and only in Him, how can you know it without recognizing Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The recognition of God is the recognition of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There is no separation of God and His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You will realize this when you understand that there is no separation between your will and mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Let the Love of God shine upon you by your acceptance of me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>My reality is yours and His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>By joining your mind with mine you are signifying your awareness that the Will of God is One.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"123#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s Oneness and ours are not separate, because His Oneness encompasses ours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To join with me is to restore His power to you because we are sharing it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I offer you only the recognition of His power in you, but in that lies all truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As we unite, we unite with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Glory be to the union of God and His holy Sons!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All glory lies in Them <i>because</i> They are united.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The miracles we do bear witness to the Will of the Father for His Son, and to our joy in uniting with His Will for us.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"123#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you unite with me you are uniting without the ego, because I have renounced the ego in myself and therefore cannot unite with yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Our union is therefore the way to renounce the ego in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The truth in both of us is beyond the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Our success in transcending the ego is guaranteed by God, and I share this confidence for both of us and all of us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I bring God’s peace back to all His children because I received it of Him for us all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing can prevail against our united wills because nothing can prevail against God’s.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"123#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you know the Will of God for you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Ask it of me who knows it for you and you will find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I will deny you nothing, as God denies me nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Ours is simply the journey back to God Who is our home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Whenever fear intrudes anywhere along the road to peace, it is because the ego has attempted to join the journey with us and cannot do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Sensing defeat and angered by it, the ego regards itself as rejected and becomes retaliative.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are invulnerable to its retaliation because I am with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>On this journey you have chosen me as your companion <i>instead</i> of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Do not attempt to hold on to both, or you will try to go in different directions and will lose the way.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"123#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s way is not mine, but it is also not yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit has one direction for all minds, and the one He taught me is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let us not lose sight of His direction through illusions, for only illusions of another direction can obscure the one for which God’s Voice speaks in all of us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Never accord the ego the power to interfere with the journey.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It has none, because the journey is the way to what is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Leave all illusions behind, and reach beyond all attempts of the ego to hold you back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I go before you because I am beyond the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Reach, therefore, for my hand because you want to transcend the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>My strength will never be wanting, and if you choose to share it you will do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"123#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I give it willingly and gladly, because I need you as much as you need me.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Can you be separated from your identification and be at peace?
