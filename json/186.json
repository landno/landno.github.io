<span data-sentence-id=\"186#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It merely brings unholiness to holiness; or what you made to what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Bringing illusion to truth, or the ego to God, is the Holy Spirit’s only function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Keep not your making from your Father, for hiding it has cost you knowledge of Him and of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The knowledge is safe, but where is your safety apart from it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The making of time to take the place of timelessness lay in the decision to be not as you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Thus truth was made past, and the present was dedicated to illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And the past, too, was changed and interposed between what always was and now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The past that you remember never was, and represents only the denial of what always was.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"186#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:1\"><span class=\"snr

class=\"snr\">2</span>It is undone because the contradiction can no longer stand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How long can contradiction stand when its impossible nature is clearly revealed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What disappears in light is not attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It merely vanishes because it is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Different realities are meaningless, for reality must be one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It cannot change with time or mood or chance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Its changelessness is what makes it real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This cannot be undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Undoing is for unreality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And this reality will do for you.</span></p></div> <div

you from everything that it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Atonement is so gentle you need but whisper to it, and all its power will rush to your assistance and support.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are not frail with God beside you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet without Him you are nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Atonement offers you God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The gift that you refused is held by Him in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Holy Spirit holds it there for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God has not left His altar, though His worshippers placed other gods upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The temple still is holy, for the Presence that dwells within it <i>is</i> Holiness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"186#4\"><p

it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Presence knows they will return to purity and to grace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The graciousness of God will take them gently in, and cover all their sense of pain and loss with the immortal assurance of their Father’s Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There, fear of death will be replaced with joy of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For God is life, and they abide in life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Life is as holy as the Holiness by which it was created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Presence of Holiness lives in everything that lives, for Holiness created life, and leaves not what It created holy as Itself.</span></p></div> <div

data-sentence-id=\"186#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet no reflections of the images of other gods must dim the mirror that would hold God’s reflection in it.</span> <span

mirror clean and clear of all the images of hidden darkness you have drawn upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God will shine upon it of Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only the clear reflection of Himself can be perceived upon it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"186#6\"><p

class=\"snr\">2</span>In darkness they are obscure, and their meaning seems to lie only in shifting interpretations, rather than in themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The reflection of God needs no interpretation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is clear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Clean but the mirror, and the message that shines forth from what the mirror holds out for everyone to see, no one can fail to understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is the message that the Holy Spirit is holding to the mirror that is in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He recognizes it because he has been taught his need for it, but knows not where to look to find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Let him, then, see it in you and share it with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"186#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#7:1\"><span

mirror of your mind clean to receive the image of the holiness that heals the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The image of holiness that shines in your mind is not obscure, and will not change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its meaning to those who look upon it is not obscure, for everyone perceives it as the

error is always the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no contradiction in what holiness calls forth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its one response is healing, without regard for what is brought to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Those who have learned to offer only healing, because of the reflection of holiness in them, are ready at last for Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There, holiness is not a reflection, but rather the actual condition of what was but reflected to them here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God is no image, and His creations, as part of Him, hold Him in them in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"186#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They do not merely reflect truth, for they <i>are</i> truth.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The
