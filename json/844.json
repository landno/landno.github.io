class=\"acim-text manual-29\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"844#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This manual is not intended to answer all questions that both teacher and pupil may raise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In fact, it covers only a few of the more obvious ones, in terms of a brief summary of some of the major concepts in the text and workbook.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not a substitute for either, but merely a supplement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>While it is called a manual for teachers, it must be remembered that only time divides teacher and pupil, so that the difference is temporary by definition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In some cases, it may be helpful for the pupil to read the manual first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Others might do better to begin with the workbook.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Still others may need to start at the more abstract level of the text.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"844#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Which is for which?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who would profit more from prayers alone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who needs but a smile, being as yet unready for more?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one should attempt to answer these questions alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Surely no teacher of God has come this far without realizing that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The curriculum is highly individualized, and all aspects are under the Holy Spirit’s particular care and guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Ask and He will answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The responsibility is His, and He alone is fit to assume it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To do so is His function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>To refer the questions to Him is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Would you want to be responsible for decisions about which you understand so little?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Be glad you have a Teacher Who cannot make a mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>His answers are always right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#2:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>Would you say that of yours?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"844#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is another advantage,—and a very important one,—in referring decisions to the Holy Spirit with increasing frequency.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you have not thought of this aspect, but its centrality is obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To follow the Holy Spirit’s guidance is to let yourself be absolved of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the essence of the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the core of the curriculum.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The imagined usurping of functions not your own is the basis of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The whole world you see reflects the illusion that you have done so, making fear inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To return the function to the One to Whom it belongs is thus the escape from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And it is this that lets the memory of love return to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Do not, then, think that following the Holy Spirit’s guidance is necessary merely because of your own inadequacies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It is the way out of hell for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"844#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here again is the paradox often referred to in the course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To say, “Of myself I can do nothing” is to gain all power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And yet it is but a seeming paradox.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As God created you, you <i>have</i> all power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The image you made of yourself has none.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit knows the truth about you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The image you made does not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet, despite its obvious and complete ignorance, this image assumes it knows all things because you have given that belief to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Such is your teaching, and the teaching of the world that was made to uphold it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But the Teacher Who knows the truth has not forgotten it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>His decisions bring benefit to all, being wholly devoid of attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And therefore incapable of arousing guilt.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"844#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who assumes a power that he does not possess is deceiving himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet to accept the power given him by God is but to acknowledge his Creator and accept His gifts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And His gifts have no limit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To ask the Holy Spirit to decide for you is simply to accept your true inheritance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Does this mean that you cannot say anything without consulting Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No, indeed!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That would hardly be practical, and it is the practical with which this course is most concerned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you have made it a habit to ask for help when and where you can, you can be confident that wisdom will be given you when you need it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Prepare for this each morning, remember God when you can throughout the day, ask the Holy Spirit’s help when it is feasible to do so, and thank Him for His guidance at night.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And your confidence will be well founded indeed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"844#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Never forget that the Holy Spirit does not depend on your words.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He understands the requests of your heart, and answers them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Does this mean that, while attack remains attractive to you, He will respond with evil?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Hardly!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For God has given Him the power to translate your prayers of the heart into His language.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He understands that an attack is a call for help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And He responds with help accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God would be cruel if He let your words replace His Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>A loving father does not let his child harm himself, or choose his own destruction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He may ask for injury, but his father will protect him still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And how much more than this does your Father love His Son?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"844#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember you are His completion and His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Remember your weakness is His strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But do not read this hastily or wrongly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If His strength is in you, what you perceive as your weakness is but illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And He has given you the means to prove it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ask all things of His Teacher, and all things are given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Not in the future but immediately; now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God does not wait, for waiting implies time and He is timeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Forget your foolish images, your sense of frailty and your fear of harm, your dreams of danger and selected “wrongs.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God knows but His Son, and as he was created so he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>In confidence I place you in His Hands, and I give thanks for you that this is so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"844#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And now in all your doings be you blessed.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God turns to you for help to save the world.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Teacher of God, His thanks He offers you,<br/> And all the world stands silent in the grace<br/> You bring from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are the Son He loves,<br/> And it is given you to be the means<br/> Through which His Voice is heard around the world,<br/> To close all things of time; to end the sight<br/> Of all things visible; and to undo<br/> All things that change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Through you is ushered in<br/> A world unseen, unheard, yet truly there.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Holy are you, and in your light the world<br/> Reflects your holiness, for you are not<br/> Alone and friendless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"844#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I give thanks for you,<br/> And join your efforts on behalf of God,<br/> Knowing they are on my behalf as well,<br/> And for all those who walk to God with me.</span></p> <p class=\"p-centered\"><span data-sentence-id=\"844#8:8\"><span
