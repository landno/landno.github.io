Illusion","inlineNumber":"V."},"annotation":"T-4.V","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-4-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"084#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All things work together for good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There are no exceptions except in the ego’s judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego exerts maximal vigilance about what it permits into awareness, and this is not the way a balanced mind holds together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego is thrown further off balance because it keeps its primary motivation from your awareness, and raises control rather than sanity to predominance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego has every reason to do this, according to the thought system which gave rise to it and which it serves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Sane judgment would inevitably judge against the ego, and must be obliterated by the ego in the interest of its self-preservation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"084#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A major source of the ego’s off-balanced state is its lack of discrimination between the body and the Thoughts of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Thoughts of God are unacceptable to the ego, because they clearly point to the nonexistence of the ego itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego therefore either distorts them or refuses to accept them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It cannot, however, make them cease to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It therefore tries to conceal not only “unacceptable” body impulses, but also the Thoughts of God, because both are threatening to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Being concerned primarily with its own preservation in the face of threat, the ego perceives them as the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>By perceiving them as the same, the ego attempts to save itself from being swept away, as it would surely be in the presence of knowledge.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"084#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Any thought system that confuses God and the body must be insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet this confusion is essential to the ego, which judges only in terms of threat or non-threat to itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In one sense the ego’s fear of God is at least logical, since the idea of Him does dispel the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But fear of the body, with which the ego identifies so closely, makes no sense at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"084#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body is the ego’s home by its own election.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the only identification with which the ego feels safe, since the body’s vulnerability is its own best argument that you cannot be of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the belief that the ego sponsors eagerly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the ego hates the body, because it cannot accept it as good enough to be its home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here is where the mind becomes actually dazed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Being told by the ego that it is really part of the body and that the body is its protector, the mind is also told that the body cannot protect it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Therefore, the mind asks, “Where can I go for protection?” to which the ego replies, “Turn to me.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The mind, and not without cause, reminds the ego that it has itself insisted that it is identified with the body, so there is no point in turning to <i>it</i> for protection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The ego has no real answer to this because there is none, but it does have a typical solution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It obliterates the question from the mind’s awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Once out of awareness the question can and does produce uneasiness, but it cannot be answered because it cannot be asked.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"084#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the question that <i>must</i> be asked: “Where can I go for protection?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>“Seek and ye shall find” does not mean that you should seek blindly and desperately for something you would not recognize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Meaningful seeking is consciously undertaken, consciously organized and consciously directed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The goal must be formulated clearly and kept in mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Learning and wanting to learn are inseparable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You learn best when you believe what you are trying to learn is of value to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>However, not everything you may want to learn has lasting value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Indeed, many of the things you want to learn may be chosen <i>because</i> their value will not last.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"084#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego thinks it is an advantage not to commit itself to anything that is eternal, because the eternal must come from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Eternalness is the one function the ego has tried to develop, but has systematically failed to achieve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego compromises with the issue of the eternal, just as it does with all issues touching on the real question in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By becoming involved with tangential issues, it hopes to hide the real question and keep it out of mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego’s characteristic busyness with nonessentials is for precisely that purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Preoccupations with problems set up to be incapable of solution are favorite ego devices for impeding learning progress.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In all these diversionary tactics, however, the one question that is never asked by those who pursue them is, “What for?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is the question that <i>you</i> must learn to ask in connection with everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What is the purpose?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Whatever it is, it will direct your efforts automatically.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"084#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>When you make a decision of purpose, then, you have made a decision about your future effort; a decision that will remain in effect unless you change your mind.</span></p></div>
