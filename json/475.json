data-sentence-id=\"475#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>While we have recognized that the ego’s plan for salvation is the opposite of God’s, we have not yet emphasized that it is an active attack on His plan, and a deliberate attempt to destroy it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the attack, God is assigned the attributes which are actually associated with the ego, while the ego appears to take on the attributes of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s fundamental wish is to replace God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In fact, the ego is the physical embodiment of that wish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it is that wish that seems to surround the mind with a body, keeping it separate and alone, and unable to reach other minds except through the body that was made to imprison it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The limit on communication cannot be the best means to expand communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the ego would have you believe that it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Although the attempt to keep the limitations that a body would impose is obvious here, it is perhaps not so apparent why holding grievances is an attack on God’s plan for salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But let us consider the kinds of things you are apt to hold grievances for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Are they not always associated with something a body does?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A person says something you do not like.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He does something that displeases you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He “betrays” his hostile thoughts in his behavior.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are not dealing here with what the person is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>On the contrary, you are exclusively concerned with what he does in a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are doing more than failing to help in freeing him from the body’s limitations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are actively trying to hold him to it by confusing it with him, and judging them as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Herein is God attacked, for if His Son is only a body, so must He be as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A creator wholly unlike his creation is inconceivable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If God is a body, what must His plan for salvation be?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What could it be but death?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In trying to present Himself as the Author of life and not of death, He is a liar and a deceiver, full of false promises and offering illusions in place of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The body’s apparent reality makes this view of God quite convincing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In fact, if the body were real, it would be difficult indeed to escape this conclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And every grievance that you hold insists that the body is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It overlooks entirely what your brother is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It reinforces your belief that he is a body, and condemns him for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And it asserts that his salvation must be death, projecting this attack onto God, and holding Him responsible for it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To this carefully prepared arena, where angry animals seek for prey and mercy cannot enter, the ego comes to save you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God made you a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Very well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let us accept this and be glad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As a body, do not let yourself be deprived of what the body offers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Take the little you can get.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God gave you nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The body is your only savior.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is the death of God and your salvation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the universal belief of the world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Some hate the body, and try to hurt and humiliate it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Others love the body, and try to glorify and exalt it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But while the body stands at the center of your concept of yourself, you are attacking God’s plan for salvation, and holding your grievances against Him and His creation, that you may not hear the Voice of truth and welcome It as Friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your chosen savior takes His place instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is your friend; He is your enemy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will try today to stop these senseless attacks on salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will try to welcome it instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your upside-down perception has been ruinous to your peace of mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have seen yourself in a body and the truth outside you, locked away from your awareness by the body’s limitations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now we are going to try to see this differently.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The light of truth is in us, where it was placed by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the body that is outside us, and is not our concern.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To be without a body is to be in our natural state.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To recognize the light of truth in us is to recognize ourselves as we are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To see our Self as separate from the body is to end the attack on God’s plan for salvation, and to accept it instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And wherever His plan is accepted, it is accomplished already.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our goal in the longer practice periods today is to become aware that God’s plan for salvation has already been accomplished in us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To achieve this goal, we must replace attack with acceptance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As long as we attack it, we cannot understand what God’s plan for us is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We are therefore attacking what we do not recognize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now we are going to try to lay judgment aside, and ask what God’s plan for us is:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What is salvation, Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Tell me, that I may understand.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Then we will wait in quiet for His answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>We have attacked God’s plan for salvation without waiting to hear what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>We have shouted our grievances so loudly that we have not listened to His Voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#10:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>We have used our grievances to close our eyes and stop our ears.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now we would see and hear and learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>“What is salvation, Father?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Ask and you will be answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Seek and you will find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We are no longer asking the ego what salvation is and where to find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We are asking it of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Be certain, then, that the answer will be true because of Whom you ask.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you feel your confidence wane and your hope of success flicker and go out, repeat your question and your request, remembering that you are asking of the infinite Creator of infinity, Who created you like Himself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"475#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What is salvation, Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Tell me, that I may understand.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"475#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He will answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Be determined to hear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"475#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>One or perhaps two shorter practice periods an hour will be enough for today, since they will be somewhat longer than usual.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These exercises should begin with this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"475#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Holding grievances is an attack on God’s plan for salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let me accept it instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"475#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is salvation, Father?</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"475#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then wait a minute or so in silence, preferably with your eyes closed, and listen for His answer.</span></p></div>
