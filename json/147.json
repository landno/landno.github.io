Healing","inlineNumber":"II."},"annotation":"T-11.II","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-11-sect-2\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"147#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If sickness is separation, the decision to heal and to be healed is the first step toward recognizing what you truly want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every attack is a step away from this, and every healing thought brings it closer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Son of God <i>has</i> both Father and Son, because he <i>is</i> both Father and Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To unite <i>having</i> and <i>being</i> is to unite your will with His, for He wills you Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you will yourself to Him because, in your perfect understanding of Him, you know there is but one Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet when you attack any part of God and His Kingdom your understanding is not perfect, and what you really want is therefore lost to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"147#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing thus becomes a lesson in understanding, and the more you practice it the better teacher and learner you become.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you have denied truth, what better witnesses to its reality could you have than those who have been healed by it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But be sure to count yourself among them, for in your willingness to join them is your healing accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Every miracle that you accomplish speaks to you of the Fatherhood of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Every healing thought that you accept, either from your brother or in your own mind, teaches you that you are God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In every hurtful thought you hold, wherever you perceive it, lies the denial of God’s Fatherhood and of your Sonship.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"147#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And denial is as total as love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot deny part of yourself, because the rest will seem to be separate and therefore without meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And being without meaning to you, you will not understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To deny meaning is to fail to understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can heal only yourself, for only God’s Son needs healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You need it because you do not understand yourself, and therefore know not what you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Having forgotten your will, you do not know what you really want.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"147#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing is a sign that you want to make whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this willingness opens your ears to the Voice of the Holy Spirit, Whose message is wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He will enable you to go far beyond the healing you would undertake, for beside your small willingness to make whole He will lay His Own complete Will and make yours whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What can the Son of God not accomplish with the Fatherhood of God in him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And yet the invitation must come from you, for you have surely learned that whom you invite as your guest will abide with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"147#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit cannot speak to an unwelcoming host, because He will not be heard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Eternal Guest remains, but His Voice grows faint in alien company.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He needs your protection, only because your care is a sign that you want Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think like Him ever so slightly, and the little spark becomes a blazing light that fills your mind so that He becomes your only Guest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Whenever you ask the ego to enter, you lessen His welcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He will remain, but you have allied yourself against Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Whatever journey you choose to take, He will go with you, waiting.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You can safely trust His patience, for He cannot leave a part of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet you need far more than patience.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"147#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will never rest until you know your function and fulfill it, for only in this can your will and your Father’s be wholly joined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To have Him is to be like Him, and He has given Himself to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You who have God must be as God, for His function became yours with His gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Invite this knowledge back into your mind, and let nothing that obscures it enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Guest Whom God sent you will teach you how to do this, if you but recognize the little spark and are willing to let it grow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your willingness need not be perfect, because His is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you will merely offer Him a little place, He will lighten it so much that you will gladly let it be increased.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And by this increase, you will begin to remember creation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"147#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you be hostage to the ego or host to God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will accept only whom you invite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are free to determine who shall be your guest, and how long he shall remain with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet this is not real freedom, for it still depends on how you see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit is there, although He cannot help you without your invitation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And the ego is nothing, whether you invite it in or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Real freedom depends on welcoming reality, and of your guests only the Holy Spirit is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"147#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Know, then, Who abides with you merely by recognizing what is there already, and do not be satisfied with imaginary comforters, for the Comforter of God is in you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"If sickness is separation, the decision to heal and to be healed is the first step
