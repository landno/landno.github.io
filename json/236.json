class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your little part is but to give the Holy Spirit the whole idea of sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And to accept the peace He gives instead, without the limits that would hold its extension back, and so would limit your awareness of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what He gives must be extended if you would have its limitless power, and use it for the Son of God’s release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not this you would be rid of, and having it you cannot limit it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If peace is homeless, so are you and so am I.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And He Who is our home is homeless with us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Is this your wish?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Would you forever be a wanderer in search of peace?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Would you invest your hope of peace and happiness in what must fail?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"236#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Faith in the eternal is always justified, for the eternal is forever kind, infinite in its patience and wholly loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It will accept you wholly, and give you peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it can unite only with what already is at peace in you, immortal as itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The body can bring you neither peace nor turmoil; neither joy nor pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is a means, and not an end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It has no purpose of itself, but only what is given to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The body will seem to be whatever is the means for reaching the goal that you assign to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Only the mind can set a purpose, and only the mind can see the means for its accomplishment, and justify its use.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Peace and guilt are both conditions of the mind, to be attained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And these conditions are the home of the emotion that calls them forth, and therefore is compatible with them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"236#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But think you which it is that is compatible with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is your choice, and it <i>is</i> free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But all that lies in it will come with it, and what you think you are can never be apart from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The body is the great seeming betrayer of faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In it lies disillusionment and the seeds of faithlessness, but only if you ask of it what it cannot give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can your mistake be reasonable grounds for depression and disillusionment, and for retaliative attack on what you think has failed you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Use not your error as the justification for your faithlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You have not sinned, but you have been mistaken in what is faithful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And the correction of your mistake will give you grounds for faith.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"236#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible to seek for pleasure through the body and not find pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is essential that this relationship be understood, for it is one the ego sees as proof of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not really punitive at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is but the inevitable result of equating yourself with the body, which is the invitation to pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it invites fear to enter and become your purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The attraction of guilt <i>must</i> enter with it, and whatever fear directs the body to do is therefore painful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It will share the pain of all illusions, and the illusion of pleasure will be the same as pain.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"236#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is not this inevitable?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Under fear’s orders the body will pursue guilt, serving its master whose attraction to guilt maintains the whole illusion of its existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This, then, is the attraction of pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Ruled by this perception the body becomes the servant of pain, seeking it dutifully and obeying the idea that pain is pleasure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this idea that underlies all of the ego’s heavy investment in the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And it is this insane relationship that it keeps hidden, and yet feeds upon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To you it teaches that the body’s pleasure is happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet to itself it whispers, “It is death.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"236#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why should the body be anything to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Certainly what it is made of is not precious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And just as certainly it has no feeling.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It transmits to you the feelings that you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Like any communication medium the body receives and sends the messages that it is given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It has no feeling for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All of the feeling with which they are invested is given by the sender and the receiver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego and the Holy Spirit both recognize this, and both also recognize that here the sender and receiver are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The Holy Spirit tells you this with joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The ego hides it, for it would keep you unaware of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Who would send messages of hatred and attack if he but understood he sends them to himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#14:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Who would accuse, make guilty and condemn himself?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"236#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s messages are always sent away from you, in the belief that for your message of attack and guilt will someone other than yourself suffer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And even if you suffer, yet someone else will suffer more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The great deceiver recognizes that this is not so, but as the “enemy” of peace, it urges you to send out all your messages of hate and free yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And to convince you this is possible, it bids the body search for pain in attack upon another, calling it pleasure and offering it to you as freedom <i>from</i> attack.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"236#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Hear not its madness, and believe not the impossible is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Forget not that the ego has dedicated the body to the goal of sin, and places in it all its faith that this can be accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its sad disciples chant the body’s praise continually, in solemn celebration of the ego’s rule.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Not one but must believe that yielding to the attraction of guilt is the escape from pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Not one but must regard the body as himself, without which he would die, and yet within which is his death equally inevitable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"236#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is not given to the ego’s disciples to realize that they have dedicated themselves to death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Freedom is offered them but they have not accepted it, and what is offered must also be received, to be truly given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the Holy Spirit, too, is a communication medium, receiving from the Father and offering His messages unto the Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Like the ego, the Holy Spirit is both the sender and the receiver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For what is sent through Him returns to Him, seeking itself along the way, and finding what it seeks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"236#17:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>So does the ego find the death <i>it</i> seeks, returning it to you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Your little part is but to give
