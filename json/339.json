Forgiveness","inlineNumber":"VI."},"annotation":"T-30.VI","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-30-sect-6\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Anger is <i>never</i> justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Attack has <i>no</i> foundation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is here escape from fear begins, and will be made complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here is the real world given in exchange for dreams of terror.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it is on this forgiveness rests, and is but natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are not asked to offer pardon where attack is due, and would be justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For that would mean that you forgive a sin by overlooking what is really there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is not pardon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For it would assume that, by responding in a way which is not justified, your pardon will become the answer to attack that has been made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And thus is pardon inappropriate, by being granted where it is not due.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Pardon is <i>always</i> justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has a sure foundation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not forgive the unforgivable, nor overlook a real attack that calls for punishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation does not lie in being asked to make unnatural responses which are inappropriate to what is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Instead, it merely asks that you respond appropriately to what is not real by not perceiving what has not occurred.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If pardon were unjustified, you would be asked to sacrifice your rights when you return forgiveness for attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But you are merely asked to see forgiveness as the natural reaction to distress that rests on error, and thus calls for help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Forgiveness is the only sane response.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It <i>keeps</i> your rights from being sacrificed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This understanding is the only change that lets the real world rise to take the place of dreams of terror.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Fear cannot arise unless attack is justified, and if it had a real foundation pardon would have none.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The real world is achieved when you perceive the basis of forgiveness is quite real and fully justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>While you regard it as a gift unwarranted, it must uphold the guilt you would “forgive.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Unjustified forgiveness is attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And this is all the world can ever give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It pardons “sinners” sometimes, but remains aware that they have sinned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so they do not merit the forgiveness that it gives.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the false forgiveness which the world employs to keep the sense of sin alive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And recognizing God is just, it seems impossible His pardon could be real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus is the fear of God the sure result of seeing pardon as unmerited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one who sees himself as guilty can avoid the fear of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But he is saved from this dilemma if he can forgive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The mind must think of its Creator as it looks upon itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you can see your brother merits pardon, you have learned forgiveness is your right as much as his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nor will you think that God intends for you a fearful judgment that your brother does not merit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For it is the truth that you can merit neither more nor less than he.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness recognized as merited will heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It gives the miracle its strength to overlook illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is how you learn that you must be forgiven too.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There can be no appearance that can not be overlooked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For if there were, it would be necessary first there be some sin that stands beyond forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There would be an error that is more than a mistake; a special form of error that remains unchangeable, eternal, and beyond correction or escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There would be one mistake that had the power to undo creation, and to make a world that could replace it and destroy the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Only if this were possible could there be some appearances that could withstand the miracle, and not be healed by it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no surer proof idolatry is what you wish than a belief there are some forms of sickness and of joylessness forgiveness cannot heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This means that you prefer to keep some idols, and are not prepared, as yet, to let all idols go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus you think that some appearances are real and not appearances at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Be not deceived about the meaning of a fixed belief that some appearances are harder to look past than others are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It always means you think forgiveness must be limited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you have set a goal of partial pardon and a limited escape from guilt for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What can this be except a false forgiveness of yourself, and everyone who seems apart from you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It must be true the miracle can heal all forms of sickness, or it cannot heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its purpose cannot be to judge which forms are real, and which appearances are true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If one appearance must remain apart from healing, one illusion must be part of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you could not escape all guilt, but only some of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You must forgive God’s Son entirely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Or you will keep an image of yourself that is not whole, and will remain afraid to look within and find escape from every idol there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Salvation rests on faith there cannot be some forms of guilt that you cannot forgive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so there cannot be appearances that have replaced the truth about God’s Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Look on your brother with the willingness to see him as he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And do not keep a part of him outside your willingness that he be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To heal is to make whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what is whole can have no missing parts that have been kept outside.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forgiveness rests on recognizing this, and being glad there cannot be some forms of sickness which the miracle must lack the power to heal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s Son is perfect, or he cannot be God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor will you know him, if you think he does not merit the escape from guilt in all its consequences and its forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no way to think of him but this, if you would know the truth about yourself.</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"339#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I thank You, Father, for Your perfect Son, and in his glory will I see my own.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"339#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here is the joyful statement that there are no forms of evil that can overcome the Will of God; the glad acknowledgment that guilt has not succeeded by your wish to make illusions real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what is this except a simple statement of the truth?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"339#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Look on your brother with this hope in you, and you will understand he could not make an error that could change the truth in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not difficult to overlook mistakes that have been given no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But what you see as having power to make an idol of the Son of God you will not pardon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For he has become to you a graven image and a sign of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is this your savior?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Is his Father wrong about His Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"339#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Or have you been deceived in him who has been given you to heal, for your salvation and deliverance?</span></p></div>
