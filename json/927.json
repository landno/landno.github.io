you would have them be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"927#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All little gods it gladly lays aside, not in resentment, but in honesty and recognition that they do not

hide in shame because it is content with what it is, knowing creation is the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"927#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Its selflessness is Self, and this it sees in every meeting, where it gladly joins with every Son of God, whose purity it recognizes that it shares with him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"927#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

holiness at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"927#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Humility has come to teach you how to understand your glory as God’s Son, and recognize the arrogance of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"927#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A dream has veiled the face of Christ from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"927#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now can

<span data-sentence-id=\"927#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Now can you pray only for what you truly share with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"927#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>For you have understood he never left, and you, who seemed alone, are one with him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"927#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span

you stand before the gate of Heaven, and your brother stands beside you there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"927#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The lawns are deep and still, for here the place
