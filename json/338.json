class=\"acim-text chap-30-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The real world is the state of mind in which the only purpose of the world is seen to be forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Fear is not its goal, for the escape from guilt becomes its aim.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The value of forgiveness is perceived and takes the place of idols, which are sought no longer, for their “gifts” are not held dear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No rules are idly set, and no demands are made of anyone or anything to twist and fit into the dream of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Instead, there is a wish to understand all things created as they really are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And it is recognized that all things must be first forgiven, and <i>then</i> understood.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here, it is thought that understanding is acquired by attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There, it is clear that by attack is understanding lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The folly of pursuing guilt as goal is fully recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And idols are not wanted there, for guilt is understood as the sole cause of pain in any form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one is tempted by its vain appeal, for suffering and death have been perceived as things not wanted and not striven for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The possibility of freedom has been grasped and welcomed, and the means by which it can be gained can now be understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The world becomes a place of hope, because its only purpose is to be a place where hope of happiness can be fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And no one stands outside this hope, because the world has been united in belief the purpose of the world is one which all must share, if hope be more than just a dream.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Not yet is Heaven quite remembered, for the purpose of forgiveness still remains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet everyone is certain he will go beyond forgiveness, and he but remains until it is made perfect in himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has no wish for anything but this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And fear has dropped away, because he is united in his purpose with himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is a hope of happiness in him so sure and constant he can barely stay and wait a little longer, with his feet still touching earth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet is he glad to wait till every hand is joined, and every heart made ready to arise and go with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For thus is he made ready for the step in which is all forgiveness left behind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The final step is God’s, because it is but God Who could create a perfect Son and share His Fatherhood with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one outside of Heaven knows how this can be, for understanding this is Heaven itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Even the real world has a purpose still beneath creation and eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But fear is gone because its purpose is forgiveness, not idolatry.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so is Heaven’s Son prepared to be himself, and to remember that the Son of God knows everything his Father understands, and understands it perfectly with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The real world still falls short of this, for this is God’s Own purpose; only His, and yet completely shared and perfectly fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The real world is a state in which the mind has learned how easily do idols go when they are still perceived but wanted not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How willingly the mind can let them go when it has understood that idols are nothing and nowhere, and are purposeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For only then can guilt and sin be seen without a purpose, and as meaningless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus is the real world’s purpose gently brought into awareness, to replace the goal of sin and guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And all that stood between your image of yourself and what you are, forgiveness washes joyfully away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet God need not create His Son again, that what is his be given back to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The gap between your brother and yourself was never there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what the Son of God knew in creation he must know again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When brothers join in purpose in the world of fear, they stand already at the edge of the real world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps they still look back, and think they see an idol that they want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet has their path been surely set away from idols toward reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For when they joined their hands it was Christ’s hand they took, and they will look on Him Whose hand they hold.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The face of Christ is looked upon before the Father is remembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For He must be unremembered till His Son has reached beyond forgiveness to the Love of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet is the Love of Christ accepted first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And then will come the knowledge They are one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How light and easy is the step across the narrow boundaries of the world of fear when you have recognized Whose hand you hold!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Within your hand is everything you need to walk with perfect confidence away from fear forever, and to go straight on, and quickly reach the gate of Heaven itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For He Whose hand you hold was waiting but for you to join Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now that you have come, would He delay in showing you the way that He must walk with you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His blessing lies on you as surely as His Father’s Love rests upon Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His gratitude to you is past your understanding, for you have enabled Him to rise from chains and go with you, together, to His Father’s house.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>An ancient hate is passing from the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And with it goes all hatred and all fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Look back no longer, for what lies ahead is all you ever wanted in your heart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Give up the world!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But not to sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You never wanted it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What happiness have you sought here that did not bring you pain?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What moment of content has not been bought at fearful price in coins of suffering?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Joy has no cost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is your sacred right, and what you pay for is not happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Be speeded on your way by honesty, and let not your experiences here deceive in retrospect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#9:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>They were not free from bitter cost and joyless consequence.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not look back except in honesty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And when an idol tempts you, think of this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"338#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There never was a time an idol brought you anything except the “gift” of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Not one was bought except at cost of pain, nor was it ever paid by you alone.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"338#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be merciful unto your brother, then.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And do not choose an idol thoughtlessly, remembering that he will pay the cost as well as you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For he will be delayed when you look back, and you will not perceive Whose loving hand you hold.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Look forward, then; in confidence walk with a happy heart that beats in hope and does not pound in fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"338#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Will of God forever lies in those whose hands are joined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Until they joined, they thought He was their enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But when they joined and shared a purpose, they were free to learn their will is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thus the Will of God must reach to their awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"338#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor can they forget for long that it is but their own.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The real world is the state of mind in which the only purpose of the world is seen to be forgiveness.
