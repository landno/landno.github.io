data-sentence-id=\"240#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it was surely not the ego that led you here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No obstacle to peace can be surmounted through its help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not open up its secrets, and bid you look on them and go beyond them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It would not have you see its weakness, and learn it has no power to keep you from the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Guide Who brought you here remains with you, and when you raise your eyes you will be ready to look on terror with no fear at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But first, lift up your eyes and look on your brother in innocence born of complete forgiveness of his illusions, and through the eyes of faith that sees them not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"240#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can look upon the fear of God unterrified, unless he has accepted the Atonement and learned illusions are not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one can stand before this obstacle alone, for he could not have reached this far unless his brother walked beside him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And no one would dare to look on it without complete forgiveness of his brother in his heart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Stand you here a while and tremble not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will be ready.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let us join together in a holy instant, here in this place where the purpose, given in a holy instant, has led you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And let us join in faith that He Who brought us here together will offer you the innocence you need, and that you will accept it for my love and His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"240#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nor is it possible to look on this too soon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the place to which everyone must come when he is ready.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Once he has found his brother he <i>is</i> ready.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet merely to reach the place is not enough.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A journey without a purpose is still meaningless, and even when it is over it seems to make no sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How can you know that it is over unless you realize its purpose is accomplished?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here, with the journey’s end before you, you <i>see</i> its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And it is here you choose whether to look upon it or wander on, only to return and make the choice again.</span></p></div> <div

preparation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only the sane can look on stark insanity and raving madness with pity and compassion, but not with fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For only if they share in it does it seem fearful, and you do share in it until you look upon your brother with perfect faith and love and tenderness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Before complete forgiveness you still stand unforgiving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are afraid of God <i>because</i> you fear your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Those you do not forgive you fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And no one reaches love with fear beside him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"240#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

class=\"snr\">3</span>And you attack him still, to keep what seems to be yourself unharmed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet in his hands is your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You see his madness, which you hate because you share it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And all the pity and forgiveness that would heal it gives way to fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Brother, you need forgiveness of your brother, for you will share in madness or in Heaven together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you and he will raise your eyes in faith together, or not at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"240#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Beside you is one who offers you the chalice of Atonement, for the Holy Spirit is in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you hold his sins against him, or accept his gift to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is this giver of salvation your friend or enemy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#13:4\"><span

power to forgive your sin, as you for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Neither can give it to himself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And yet your savior stands beside each one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Let him be what he is, and seek not to make of love an

will give it truly, for it will be both offered and received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no grace of Heaven that you cannot offer to your brother, and receive from your most holy Friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let him withhold it not, for by receiving it you offer it to him.</span> <span

been given you to give your brother, and thus receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#15:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Whom you forgive is free, and what you give you share.</span> <span

which we come again; to which we will return until redemption is accomplished and received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Think who your brother is, before you would condemn him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And offer thanks to God that he is holy, and has been given the gift of holiness for you.</span> <span

you and your brother free together, as you offer to the Holy Spirit this same gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#17:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And giving it, receive it of Him in return for what you gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#17:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He leadeth you and me together, that we might meet here in this holy place, and make the same

carefully how you would look upon the giver of this gift, for as you look on him so will the gift itself appear to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#20:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As he is seen as either the giver of guilt or of salvation, so will his offering be seen and so received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#20:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The crucified give pain because they are in pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"240#20:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But the redeemed give joy because they have been healed of pain.</span> <span
