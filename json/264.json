data-sentence-id=\"264#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The introduction of reason into the ego’s thought system is the beginning of its undoing, for reason and the ego are contradictory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor is it possible for them to coexist in your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For reason’s goal is to make plain, and therefore obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can <i>see</i> reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is not a play on words, for here is the beginning of a vision that has meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Vision is sense, quite literally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If it is not the body’s sight, it <i>must</i> be understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For it is plain, and what is obvious is not ambiguous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It can be understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And here do reason and the ego separate, to go their separate ways.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"264#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s whole continuance depends on its belief you cannot learn this course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Share this belief, and reason will be unable to see your errors and make way for their correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For reason sees through errors, telling you what you thought was real is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Reason can see the difference between sin and mistakes, because it wants correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore, it tells you what you thought was uncorrectable can be corrected, and thus it must have been an error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego’s opposition to correction leads to its fixed belief in sin and disregard of errors.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It looks on nothing that can be corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Thus does the ego damn, and reason save.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"264#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Reason is not salvation in itself, but it makes way for peace and brings you to a state of mind in which salvation can be given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Sin is a block, set like a heavy gate, locked and without a key, across the road to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one who looks on it without the help of reason would try to pass it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The body’s eyes behold it as solid granite, so thick it would be madness to attempt to pass it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet reason sees through it easily, because it is an error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The form it takes cannot conceal its emptiness from reason’s eyes.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"264#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only the form of error attracts the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Meaning it does not recognize, and does not see if it is there or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Everything the body’s eyes can see is a mistake, an error in perception, a distorted fragment of the whole without the meaning that the whole would give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet mistakes, regardless of their form, can be corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Sin is but error in a special form the ego venerates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It would preserve all errors and make them sins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For here is its own stability, its heavy anchor in the shifting world it made; the rock on which its church is built, and where its worshippers are bound to bodies, believing the body’s freedom is their own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"264#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Reason will tell you that the form of error is not what makes it a mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If what the form conceals is a mistake, the form cannot prevent correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body’s eyes see only form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They cannot see beyond what they were made to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And they were made to look on error and not see past it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Theirs is indeed a strange perception, for they can see only illusions, unable to look beyond the granite block of sin, and stopping at the outside form of nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To this distorted form of vision the outside of everything, the wall that stands between you and the truth, is wholly true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet how can sight that stops at nothingness, as if it were a solid wall, see truly?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is held back by form, having been made to guarantee that nothing else but form will be perceived.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"264#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These eyes, made not to see, will never see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the idea they represent left not its maker, and it is their maker that sees through them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What was its maker’s goal but not to see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For this the body’s eyes are perfect means, but not for seeing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>See how the body’s eyes rest on externals and cannot go beyond.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Watch how they stop at nothingness, unable to go beyond the form to meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing so blinding as perception of form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For sight of form means understanding has been obscured.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"264#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only mistakes have different forms, and so they can deceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can change form <i>because</i> it is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It could not be reality <i>because</i> it can be changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Reason will tell you that if form is not reality it must be an illusion, and is not there to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And if you see it you must be mistaken, for you are seeing what can <i>not</i> be real as if it were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What cannot see beyond what is not there must be distorted perception, and must perceive illusions as the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Could it, then, recognize the truth?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"264#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let not the form of his mistakes keep you from him whose holiness is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let not the vision of his holiness, the sight of which would show you your forgiveness, be kept from you by what the body’s eyes can see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let your awareness of your brother not be blocked by your perception of his sins and of his body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is there in him that you would attack except what you associate with his body, which you believe can sin?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Beyond his errors is his holiness and your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You gave him not his holiness, but tried to see your sins in him to save yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And yet, his holiness <i>is</i> your forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can you be saved by making sinful the one whose holiness is your salvation?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"264#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A holy relationship, however newly born, must value holiness above all else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Unholy values will produce confusion, and in awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In an unholy relationship, each one is valued because he seems to justify the other’s sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each sees within the other what impels him to sin against his will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus he lays his sins upon the other, and is attracted to him to perpetuate his sins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And so it must become impossible for each to see himself as causing sin by his desire to have sin real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"264#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet reason sees a holy relationship as what it is; a common state of mind, where both give errors gladly to correction, that both may happily be healed as one.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The introduction of reason into the ego’s thought system is the beginning of its undoing, for
