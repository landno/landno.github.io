<span data-sentence-id=\"263#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The opposite of illusions is not disillusionment but truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only to the ego, to which truth is meaningless, do they appear to be the only alternatives, and different from each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In truth they are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Both bring the same amount of misery, though each one seems to be the way to lose the misery the other brings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Every illusion carries pain and suffering in the dark folds of the heavy garments in which it hides its nothingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet by these dark and heavy garments are those who seek illusions covered, and hidden from the joy of truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth is the opposite of illusions because it offers joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What else but joy could be the opposite of misery?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To leave one kind of misery and seek another is hardly an escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To change illusions is to make no change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The search for joy in misery is senseless, for how could joy be found in misery?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All that is possible in the dark world of misery is to select some aspects out of it, see them as different, and define the difference as joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet to perceive a difference where none exists will surely fail to make a difference.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Illusions carry only guilt and suffering, sickness and death, to their believers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The form in which they are accepted is irrelevant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No form of misery in reason’s eyes can be confused with joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Joy is eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can be sure indeed that any seeming happiness that does not last is really fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Joy does not turn to sorrow, for the eternal cannot change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But sorrow can be turned to joy, for time gives way to the eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Only the timeless must remain unchanged, but everything in time can change with time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet if the change be real and not imagined, illusions must give way to truth, and not to other dreams that are but equally unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This is no difference.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Reason will tell you that the only way to escape from misery is to recognize it <i>and go the other way</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Truth is the same and misery the same, but they are different from each other in every way, in every instance and without exception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To believe that one exception can exist is to confuse what is the same with what is different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>One illusion cherished and defended against the truth makes all truth meaningless, and all illusions real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Such is the power of belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It cannot compromise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And faith in innocence is faith in sin, if the belief excludes one living thing and holds it out, apart from its forgiveness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Both reason and the ego will tell you this, but what they make of it is not the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego will assure you now that it is impossible for you to see no guilt in anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And if this seeing is the only means by which escape from guilt can be attained, then the belief in sin must be eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet reason looks on this another way, for reason sees the source of an idea as what will make it either true or false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This must be so, if the idea is like its source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Therefore, says reason, if escape from guilt was given to the Holy Spirit as His purpose, and by One to Whom nothing He wills can be impossible, the means for its attainment are more than possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They must be there, and you must have them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is a crucial period in this course, for here the separation of you and the ego must be made complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For if you have the means to let the Holy Spirit’s purpose be accomplished, they can be used.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And through their use will you gain faith in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet to the ego this must be impossible, and no one undertakes to do what holds no hope of ever being done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span><i>You</i> know what your Creator wills is possible, but what you made believes it is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Now must you choose between yourself and an illusion of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Not both, but one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There is no point in trying to avoid this one decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It must be made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Faith and belief can fall to either side, but reason tells you misery lies only on one side and joy upon the other.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forsake not now your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you who are the same will not decide alone nor differently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Either you give each other life or death; either you are each other’s savior or his judge, offering him sanctuary or condemnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This course will be believed entirely or not at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it is wholly true or wholly false, and cannot be but partially believed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will either escape from misery entirely or not at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Reason will tell you that there is no middle ground where you can pause uncertainly, waiting to choose between the joy of Heaven and the misery of hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Until you choose Heaven, you <i>are</i> in hell and misery.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no part of Heaven you can take and weave into illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor is there one illusion you can enter Heaven with.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A savior cannot be a judge, nor mercy condemnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And vision cannot damn, but only bless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Whose function is to save, will save.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span><i>How</i> He will do it is beyond your understanding, but <i>when</i> must be your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For time you made, and time you can command.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You are no more a slave to time than to the world you made.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us look closer at the whole illusion that what you made has power to enslave its maker.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the same belief that caused the separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the meaningless idea that thoughts can leave the thinker’s mind, be different from it and in opposition to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If this were true, thoughts would not be the mind’s extensions, but its enemies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And here we see again another form of the same fundamental illusion we have seen many times before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only if it were possible the Son of God could leave his Father’s Mind, make himself different and oppose His Will, would it be possible that the self he made, and all it made, should be his master.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Behold the great projection, but look on it with the decision that it must be healed, and not with fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothing you made has any power over you unless you still would be apart from your Creator, and with a will opposed to His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For only if you would believe His Son could be His enemy does it seem possible that what you made is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You would condemn His joy to misery, and make Him different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And all the misery you made has been your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Are you not glad to learn it is not true?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Is it not welcome news to hear not one of the illusions that you made replaced the truth?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only <i>your</i> thoughts have been impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Salvation cannot be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It <i>is</i> impossible to look upon your savior as your enemy and recognize him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it is possible to recognize him for what he is, if God would have it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What God has given to your holy relationship is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For what He gave the Holy Spirit to give to you <i>He gave</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Would you not look upon the savior that has been given you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And would you not exchange, in gratitude, the function of an executioner you gave him for the one he has in truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Receive of him what God has given him for you, not what you tried to give yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"263#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Beyond the body that you interposed between you and your brother, and shining in the golden light that reaches it from the bright, endless circle that extends forever, is your holy relationship, beloved of God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How still it rests, in time and yet beyond, immortal yet on earth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How great the power that lies in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Time waits upon its will, and earth will be as it would have it be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here is no separate will, nor the desire that anything be separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Its will has no exceptions, and what it wills is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Every illusion brought to its forgiveness is gently overlooked and disappears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For at its center Christ has been reborn, to light His home with vision that overlooks the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Would you not have this holy home be yours as well?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#12:10\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"263#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All you need do to dwell in quiet here with Christ is share His vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Quickly and gladly is His vision given anyone who is but willing to see his brother sinless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And no one can remain beyond this willingness, if you would be released entirely from all effects of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would you have partial forgiveness for yourself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can you reach Heaven while a single sin still tempts you to remain in misery?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Heaven is the home of perfect purity, and God created it for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"263#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Look on your holy brother, sinless as yourself, and let him lead you there.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The opposite of illusions is not disillusionment but truth.
