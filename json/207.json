data-sentence-id=\"207#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The search for the special relationship is the sign that you equate yourself with the ego and not with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the special relationship has value only to the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To the ego, unless a relationship has special value it has no meaning, for it perceives all love as special.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet this cannot be natural, for it is unlike the relationship of God and His Son, and all relationships that are unlike this one <i>must</i> be unnatural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For God created love as He would have it be, and gave it as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Love has no meaning except as its Creator defined it by His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is impossible to define it otherwise and understand it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Love is freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To look for it by placing yourself in bondage is to separate yourself from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the Love of God, no longer seek for union in separation, nor for freedom in bondage!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As you release, so will you be released.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forget this not, or Love will be unable to find you and comfort you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a way in which the Holy Spirit asks your help, if you would have His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The holy instant is His most helpful aid in protecting you from the attraction of guilt, the real lure in the special relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not recognize that this is its real appeal, for the ego has taught you that freedom lies in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the closer you look at the special relationship, the more apparent it becomes that it must foster guilt and therefore must imprison.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The special relationship is totally meaningless without a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you value it, you must also value the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what you value you will keep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The special relationship is a device for limiting your self to a body, and for limiting your perception of others to theirs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Great Rays would establish the total lack of value of the special relationship, if they were seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For in seeing them the body would disappear, because its value would be lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so your whole investment in seeing it would be withdrawn from it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You see the world you value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>On this side of the bridge you see the world of separate bodies, seeking to join each other in separate unions and to become one by losing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When two individuals seek to become one, they are trying to decrease their magnitude.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each would deny his power, for the separate union excludes the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Far more is left outside than would be taken in, for God is left without and <i>nothing</i> taken in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If one such union were made in perfect faith, the universe would enter into it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet the special relationship the ego seeks does not include even one whole individual.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego wants but part of him, and sees only this part and nothing else.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Across the bridge it is so different!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For a time the body is still seen, but not exclusively, as it is seen here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The little spark that holds the Great Rays within it is also visible, and this spark cannot be limited long to littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Once you have crossed the bridge, the value of the body is so diminished in your sight that you will see no need at all to magnify it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For you will realize that the only value the body has is to enable you to bring your brothers to the bridge with you, and to be released together there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The bridge itself is nothing more than a transition in the perspective of reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>On this side, everything you see is grossly distorted and completely out of perspective.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What is little and insignificant is magnified, and what is strong and powerful cut down to littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the transition there is a period of confusion, in which a sense of actual disorientation may occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But fear it not, for it means only that you have been willing to let go your hold on the distorted frame of reference that seemed to hold your world together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This frame of reference is built around the special relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Without this illusion there could be no meaning you would still seek here.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The urgency is only in dislodging your mind from its fixed position here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This will not leave you homeless and without a frame of reference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The period of disorientation, which precedes the actual transition, is far shorter than the time it took to fix your mind so firmly on illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Delay will hurt you now more than before, only because you realize it <i>is</i> delay, and that escape from pain is really possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Find hope and comfort, rather than despair, in this: You could not long find even the illusion of love in any special relationship here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For you are no longer wholly insane, and you would soon recognize the guilt of self-betrayal for what it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing you seek to strengthen in the special relationship is really part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you cannot keep part of the thought system that taught you it was real, and understand the Thought that <i>knows</i> what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have allowed the Thought of your reality to enter your mind, and because you invited it, it will abide with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your love for it will not allow you to betray yourself, and you could not enter into a relationship where it could not go with you, for you would not want to be apart from it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be glad you have escaped the mockery of salvation the ego offered you, and look not back with longing on the travesty it made of your relationships.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now no one need suffer, for you have come too far to yield to the illusion of the beauty and holiness of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only the wholly insane could look on death and suffering, sickness and despair, and see it thus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What guilt has wrought is ugly, fearful and very dangerous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>See no illusion of truth and beauty there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And be you thankful that there <i>is</i> a place where truth and beauty wait for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Go on to meet them gladly, and learn how much awaits you for the simple willingness to give up nothing <i>because</i> it is nothing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The new perspective you will gain from crossing over will be the understanding of where Heaven <i>is.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From this side, it seems to be outside and across the bridge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet as you cross to join it, it will join with you and become one with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will think, in glad astonishment, that for all this you gave up <i>nothing</i>!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The joy of Heaven, which has no limit, is increased with each light that returns to take its rightful place within it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Wait no longer, for the Love of God and <i>you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And may the holy instant speed you on the way, as it will surely do if you but let it come to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"207#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit asks only this little help of you: Whenever your thoughts wander to a special relationship which still attracts you, enter with Him into a holy instant, and there let Him release you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He needs only your willingness to share His perspective to give it to you completely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And your willingness need not be complete because His is perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is His task to atone for your unwillingness by His perfect faith, and it is His faith you share with Him there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Out of your recognition of your unwillingness for your release, His perfect willingness is given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Call upon Him, for Heaven is at His Call.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"207#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And let Him call on Heaven for you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The search for the special relationship is the sign that you equate yourself with the ego and not with God.
