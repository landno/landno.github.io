data-sentence-id=\"150#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no need to shrink from illusions, for they cannot be dangerous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We are ready to look more closely at the ego’s thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it, and since you realize you do not want it, you must be ready.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let us be very calm in doing this, for we are merely looking honestly for truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The “dynamics” of the ego will be our lesson for a while, for we must look first at this to see beyond it, since you have made it real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We will undo this error quietly together, and then look beyond it to truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is healing but the removal of all that stands in the way of knowledge?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And how else can one dispel illusions except by looking at them directly, without protecting them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Be not afraid, therefore, for what you will be looking at is the source of fear, and you are beginning to learn that fear is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are also learning that its effects can be dispelled merely by denying their reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The next step is obviously to recognize that what has no effects does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Laws do not operate in a vacuum, and what leads to nothing has not happened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If reality is recognized by its extension, what leads to nothing could not be real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not be afraid, then, to look upon fear, for it cannot be seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Clarity undoes confusion by definition, and to look upon darkness through light must dispel it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us begin this lesson in “ego dynamics” by understanding that the term itself does not mean anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It contains the very contradiction in terms that makes it meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>“Dynamics” implies the power to do something, and the whole separation fallacy lies in the belief that the ego <i>has</i> the power to do anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego is fearful to you because you believe this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the truth is very simple:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"150#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All power is of God.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What is not of Him has no power to do anything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When we look at the ego, then, we are not considering dynamics but delusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can surely regard a delusional system without fear, for it cannot have any effects if its source is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fear becomes more obviously inappropriate if you recognize the ego’s goal, which is so clearly senseless that any effort on its behalf is necessarily expended on nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego’s goal is quite explicitly ego autonomy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>From the beginning, then, its purpose is to be separate, sufficient unto itself and independent of any power except its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is why it is the symbol of separation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every idea has a purpose, and its purpose is always the natural outcome of what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Everything that stems from the ego is the natural outcome of its central belief, and the way to undo its results is merely to recognize that their source is not natural, being out of accord with your true nature.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I said before that to will contrary to God is wishful thinking and not real willing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His Will is One <i>because</i> the extension of His Will cannot be unlike itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The real conflict you experience, then, is between the ego’s idle wishes and the Will of God, which you share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can this be a real conflict?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yours is the independence of creation, not of autonomy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your whole creative function lies in your complete dependence on God, Whose function He shares with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By His willingness to share it, He became as dependent on you as you are on Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not ascribe the ego’s arrogance to Him Who wills not to be independent of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has included you in His Autonomy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can you believe that autonomy is meaningful apart from Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The belief in ego autonomy is costing you the knowledge of your dependence on God, in which your freedom lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego sees all dependency as threatening, and has twisted even your longing for God into a means of establishing itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But do not be deceived by its interpretation of your conflict.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego always attacks on behalf of separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Believing it has the power to do this it does nothing else, because its goal of autonomy <i>is</i> nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego is totally confused about reality, but it does not lose sight of its goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is much more vigilant than you are, because it is perfectly certain of its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are confused because you do not recognize yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You must recognize that the last thing the ego wishes you to realize is that you are afraid of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For if the ego could give rise to fear, it would diminish your independence and weaken your power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet its one claim to your allegiance is that it can give power to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Without this belief you would not listen to it at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How, then, can its existence continue if you realize that, by accepting it, you are belittling yourself and depriving yourself of power?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego can and does allow you to regard yourself as supercilious, unbelieving, “lighthearted,” distant, emotionally shallow, callous, uninvolved and even desperate, but not really afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Minimizing fear, but not its undoing, is the ego’s constant effort, and is indeed a skill at which it is very ingenious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How can it preach separation without upholding it through fear, and would you listen to it if you recognized this is what it is doing?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your recognition that whatever seems to separate you from God is only fear, regardless of the form it takes and quite apart from how the ego wants you to experience it, is therefore the basic ego threat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its dream of autonomy is shaken to its foundation by this awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For though you may countenance a false idea of independence, you will not accept the cost of fear if you recognize it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet this is the cost, and the ego cannot minimize it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you overlook love you are overlooking yourself, and you must fear unreality <i>because</i> you have denied yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>By believing that you have successfully attacked truth, you are believing that attack has power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Very simply, then, you have become afraid of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And no one wants to find what he believes would destroy him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If the ego’s goal of autonomy could be accomplished God’s purpose could be defeated, and this is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only by learning what fear is can you finally learn to distinguish the possible from the impossible and the false from the true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>According to the ego’s teaching, <i>its</i> goal can be accomplished and God’s purpose can <i>not.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>According to the Holy Spirit’s teaching, <i>only</i> God’s purpose can be accomplished, and it is accomplished already.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God is as dependent on you as you are on Him, because His Autonomy encompasses yours, and is therefore incomplete without it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can only establish your autonomy by identifying with Him, and fulfilling your function as it exists in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego believes that to accomplish its goal is happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But it is given you to know that God’s function is yours, and happiness cannot be found apart from Your joint Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Recognize only that the ego’s goal, which you have pursued so diligently, has merely brought you fear, and it becomes difficult to maintain that fear is happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Upheld by fear, this is what the ego would have you believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet God’s Son is not insane, and cannot believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Let him but recognize it and he will not accept it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For only the insane would choose fear in place of love, and only the insane could believe that love can be gained by attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#12:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But the sane realize that only attack could produce fear, from which the Love of God completely protects them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego analyzes; the Holy Spirit accepts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The appreciation of wholeness comes only through acceptance, for to analyze means to break down or to separate out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The attempt to understand totality by breaking it down is clearly the characteristically contradictory approach of the ego to everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego believes that power, understanding and truth lie in separation, and to establish this belief it must attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Unaware that the belief cannot be established, and obsessed with the conviction that separation is salvation, the ego attacks everything it perceives by breaking it into small, disconnected parts, without meaningful relationships and therefore without meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego will always substitute chaos for meaning, for if separation is salvation, harmony is threat.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s interpretations of the laws of perception are, and would have to be, the exact opposite of the Holy Spirit’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego focuses on error and overlooks truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It makes real every mistake it perceives, and with characteristically circular reasoning concludes that because of the mistake consistent truth must be meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The next step, then, is obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If consistent truth is meaningless, inconsistency must be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Holding error clearly in mind, and protecting what it has made real, the ego proceeds to the next step in its thought system: Error is real and truth is error.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego makes no attempt to understand this, and it is clearly not understandable, but the ego does make every attempt to demonstrate it, and this it does constantly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Analyzing to attack meaning, the ego succeeds in overlooking it and is left with a series of fragmented perceptions which it unifies on behalf of itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This, then, becomes the universe it perceives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it is this universe which, in turn, becomes its demonstration of its own reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not underestimate the appeal of the ego’s demonstrations to those who would listen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Selective perception chooses its witnesses carefully, and its witnesses are consistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The case for insanity is strong to the insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For reasoning ends at its beginning, and no thought system transcends its source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet reasoning without meaning cannot demonstrate anything, and those who are convinced by it must be deluded.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can the ego teach truly when it overlooks truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#16:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Can it perceive what it has denied?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#16:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Its witnesses do attest to its denial, but hardly to what it has denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#16:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The ego looks straight at the Father and does not see Him, for it has denied His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"150#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would <i>you</i> remember the Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Accept His Son and you will remember Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing can demonstrate that His Son is unworthy, for nothing can prove that a lie is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you see of His Son through the eyes of the ego is a demonstration that His Son does not exist, yet where the Son is the Father must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Accept what God does not deny, and it will demonstrate its truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#17:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The witnesses for God stand in His light and behold what He created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#17:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Their silence is the sign that they have beheld God’s Son, and in the Presence of Christ they need demonstrate nothing, for Christ speaks to them of Himself and of His Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"150#17:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They are silent because Christ speaks to them, and it is His words they speak.</span></p></div> <div
