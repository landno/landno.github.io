data-sentence-id=\"311#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Pain demonstrates the body must be real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a loud, obscuring voice whose shrieks would silence what the Holy Spirit says, and keep His words from your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Pain compels attention, drawing it away from Him and focusing upon itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its purpose is the same as pleasure, for they both are means to make the body real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What shares a common purpose is the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the law of purpose, which unites all those who share in it within itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Pleasure and pain are equally unreal, because their purpose cannot be achieved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Thus are they means for nothing, for they have a goal without a meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And they share the lack of meaning which their purpose has.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"311#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sin shifts from pain to pleasure, and again to pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For either witness is the same, and carries but one message: “You are here, within this body, and you can be hurt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can have pleasure, too, but only at the cost of pain.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>These witnesses are joined by many more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each one seems different because it has a different name, and so it seems to answer to a different sound.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Except for this, the witnesses of sin are all alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Call pleasure pain, and it will hurt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Call pain a pleasure, and the pain behind the pleasure will be felt no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Sin’s witnesses but shift from name to name, as one steps forward and another back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet which is foremost makes no difference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Sin’s witnesses hear but the call of death.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"311#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This body, purposeless within itself, holds all your memories and all your hopes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You use its eyes to see, its ears to hear, and let it tell you what it is it feels.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span><i>It does not know.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It tells you but the names you gave to it to use, when you call forth the witnesses to its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You cannot choose among them which are real, for any one you choose is like the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This name or that, but nothing more, you choose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You do not make a witness true because you called him by truth’s name.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The truth is found in him if it is truth he represents.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And otherwise he lies, if you should call him by the holy Name of God Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"311#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s Witness sees no witnesses against the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Neither does He harken to the witnesses by other names that speak in other ways for its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He knows it is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For nothing could contain what you believe it holds within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor could it tell a part of God Himself what it should feel and what its function is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet must He love whatever you hold dear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And for each witness to the body’s death He sends a witness to your life in Him Who knows no death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Each miracle He brings is witness that the body is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Its pains and pleasures does He heal alike, for all sin’s witnesses do His replace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"311#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle makes no distinctions in the names by which sin’s witnesses are called.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It merely proves that what they represent has no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this it proves because its own effects have come to take their place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It matters not the name by which you called your suffering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is no longer there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The One Who brings the miracle perceives them all as one, and called by name of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As fear is witness unto death, so is the miracle the witness unto life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is a witness no one can deny, for it is the effects of life it brings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The dying live, the dead arise, and pain has vanished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet a miracle speaks not but for itself, but what it represents.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"311#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Love, too, has symbols in a world of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The miracle forgives because it stands for what is past forgiveness and is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How foolish and insane it is to think a miracle is bound by laws that it came solely to undo!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The laws of sin have different witnesses with different strengths.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And they attest to different sufferings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet to the One Who sends forth miracles to bless the world, a tiny stab of pain, a little worldly pleasure, and the throes of death itself are but a single sound; a call for healing, and a plaintive cry for help within a world of misery.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is their sameness that the miracle attests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is their sameness that it proves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The laws that call them different are dissolved, and shown as powerless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The purpose of a miracle is to accomplish this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And God Himself has guaranteed the strength of miracles for what they witness to.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"311#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be you then witness to the miracle, and not the laws of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no need to suffer any more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But there <i>is</i> need that you be healed, because the suffering and sorrow of the world have made it deaf to its salvation and deliverance.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"311#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The resurrection of the world awaits your healing and your happiness, that you may demonstrate the healing of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The holy instant will replace all sin if you but carry its effects with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And no one will elect to suffer more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What better function could you serve than this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be healed that you may heal, and suffer not the laws of sin to be applied to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"311#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And truth will be revealed to you who chose to let love’s symbols take the place of sin.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Pain
