data-sentence-id=\"309#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In quietness are all things answered, and is every problem quietly resolved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In conflict there can be no answer and no resolution, for its purpose is to make no resolution possible, and to ensure no answer will be plain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A problem set in conflict has no answer, for it is seen in different ways.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what would be an answer from one point of view is not an answer in another light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You <i>are</i> in conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thus it must be clear you cannot answer anything at all, for conflict has no limited effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet if God gave an answer there must be a way in which your problems are resolved, for what He wills already has been done.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"309#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus it must be that time is not involved and every problem can be answered <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it must also be that, in your state of mind, solution is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, God must have given you a way of reaching to another state of mind in which the answer is already there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Such is the holy instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is here that all your problems should be brought and left.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here they belong, for here their answer is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And where its answer is, a problem must be simple and be easily resolved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It must be pointless to attempt to solve a problem where the answer cannot be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet just as surely it must be resolved, if it is brought to where the answer is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"309#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Attempt to solve no problems but within the holy instant’s surety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For there the problem <i>will</i> be answered and resolved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Outside there will be no solution, for there is no answer there that could be found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nowhere outside a single, simple question is ever asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The world can only ask a double question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>One with many answers can have no answers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>None of them will do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It does not ask a question to be answered, but only to restate its point of view.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"309#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All questions asked within this world are but a way of looking, not a question asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A question asked in hate cannot be answered, because it is an answer in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A double question asks and answers, both attesting the same thing in different form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The world asks but one question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this: “Of these illusions, which of them <i>is</i> true?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Which ones establish peace and offer joy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And which can bring escape from all the pain of which this world is made?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Whatever form the question takes, its purpose is the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It asks but to establish sin is real, and answers in the form of preference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>“Which sin do you prefer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>That is the one that you should choose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The others are not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>What can the body get that you would want the most of all?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>It is your servant and also your friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>But tell it what you want, and it will serve you lovingly and well.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:16\"><span class=\"snr\">16</span>And this is not a question, for it tells you what you want and where to go for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#4:17\"><span class=\"snr\">17</span>It leaves no room to question its beliefs, except that what it states takes question’s form.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"309#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A pseudo-question has no answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It dictates the answer even as it asks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus is all questioning within the world a form of propaganda for itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Just as the body’s witnesses are but the senses from within itself, so are the answers to the questions of the world contained within the questions that are asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Where answers represent the questions, they add nothing new and nothing has been learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>An honest question is a learning tool that asks for something that you do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It does not set conditions for response, but merely asks what the response should be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But no one in a conflict state is free to ask this question, for he does not <i>want</i> an honest answer where the conflict ends.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"309#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only within the holy instant can an honest question honestly be asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And from the meaning of the question does the meaningfulness of the answer come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here is it possible to separate your wishes from the answer, so it can be given you and also be received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The answer is provided everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it is only here it can be heard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>An honest answer asks no sacrifice because it answers questions truly asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The questions of the world but ask of whom is sacrifice demanded, asking not if sacrifice is meaningful at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so, unless the answer tells “of whom,” it will remain unrecognized, unheard, and thus the question is preserved intact because it gave the answer to itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The holy instant is the interval in which the mind is still enough to hear an answer that is not entailed within the question asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It offers something new and different from the question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>How could it be answered if it but repeats itself?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"309#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Therefore, attempt to solve no problems in a world from which the answer has been barred.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But bring the problem to the only place that holds the answer lovingly for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here are the answers that will solve your problems because they stand apart from them, and see what can be answered; what the question <i>is.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Within the world the answers merely raise another question, though they leave the first unanswered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"309#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In the holy instant, you can bring the question to the answer, and receive the answer that was made for you.</span></p></div>
