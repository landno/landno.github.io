<span data-sentence-id=\"208#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible to let the past go without relinquishing the special relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the special relationship is an attempt to re-enact the past and change it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Imagined slights, remembered pain, past disappointments, perceived injustices and deprivations all enter into the special relationship, which becomes a way in which you seek to restore your wounded self-esteem.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What basis would you have for choosing a special partner without the past?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Every such choice is made because of something “evil” in the past to which you cling, and for which must someone else atone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The special relationship takes vengeance on the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>By seeking to remove suffering in the past, it overlooks the present in its preoccupation with the past and its total commitment to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No special relationship is experienced in the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Shades of the past envelop it, and make it what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It has no meaning in the present, and if it means nothing now, it cannot have any real meaning at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How can you change the past except in fantasy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And who can give you what you think the past deprived you of?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The past is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Do not seek to lay the blame for deprivation on it, for the past is gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You cannot really <i>not</i> let go what has already gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It must be, therefore, that you are maintaining the illusion that it has not gone because you think it serves some purpose that you want fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And it must also be that this purpose could not be fulfilled in the present, but only in the past.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not underestimate the intensity of the ego’s drive for vengeance on the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is completely savage and completely insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the ego remembers everything you have done that has offended it, and seeks retribution of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The fantasies it brings to its chosen relationships in which to act out its hate are fantasies of your destruction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the ego holds the past against you, and in your escape from the past it sees itself deprived of the vengeance it believes you so justly merit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet without your alliance in your own destruction, the ego could not hold you to the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In the special relationship you are allowing your destruction to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>That this is insane is obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But what is less obvious is that the present is useless to you while you pursue the ego’s goal as its ally.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The past is gone; seek not to preserve it in the special relationship that binds you to it, and would teach you salvation is past and so you must return to the past to find salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no fantasy that does not contain the dream of retribution for the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you act out the dream, or let it go?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the special relationship it does not seem to be an acting out of vengeance that you seek.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And even when the hatred and the savagery break briefly through, the illusion of love is not profoundly shaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet the one thing the ego never allows to reach awareness is that the special relationship is the acting out of vengeance on yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet what else could it be?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In seeking the special relationship, you look not for glory in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have denied that it is there, and the relationship becomes your substitute for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And vengeance becomes your substitute for Atonement, and the escape from vengeance becomes your loss.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Against the ego’s insane notion of salvation the Holy Spirit gently lays the holy instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We said before that the Holy Spirit must teach through comparisons, and uses opposites to point to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The holy instant is the opposite of the ego’s fixed belief in salvation through vengeance for the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the holy instant it is understood that the past is gone, and with its passing the drive for vengeance has been uprooted and has disappeared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The stillness and the peace of <i>now</i> enfold you in perfect gentleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Everything is gone except the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For a time you may attempt to bring illusions into the holy instant, to hinder your full awareness of the complete difference, in all respects, between your experience of truth and illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you will not attempt this long.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In the holy instant the power of the Holy Spirit will prevail, because you joined Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The illusions you bring with you will weaken the experience of Him for a while, and will prevent you from keeping the experience in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the holy instant is eternal, and your illusions of time will not prevent the timeless from being what it is, nor you from experiencing it as it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What God has given you is truly given, and will be truly received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For God’s gifts have no reality apart from your receiving them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your receiving completes His giving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will receive <i>because</i> it is His Will to give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He gave the holy instant to be given you, and it is impossible that you receive it not <i>because</i> He gave it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When He willed that His Son be free, His Son <i>was</i> free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In the holy instant is His reminder that His Son will always be exactly as he was created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And everything the Holy Spirit teaches is to remind you that you have received what God has given you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is nothing you can hold against reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All that must be forgiven are the illusions you have held against your brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Their reality has no past, and only illusions can be forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God holds nothing against anyone, for He is incapable of illusions of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Release your brothers from the slavery of their illusions by forgiving them for the illusions you perceive in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thus will you learn that you have been forgiven, for it is you who offered them illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In the holy instant this is done for you in time, to bring you the true condition of Heaven.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember that you always choose between truth and illusion; between the real Atonement that would heal and the ego’s “atonement” that would destroy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The power of God and all His Love, without limit, will support you as you seek only your place in the plan of Atonement arising from His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Be an ally of God and not the ego in seeking how Atonement can come to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His help suffices, for His Messenger understands how to restore the Kingdom to you, and to place all your investment in salvation in your relationship with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Seek and <i>find</i> His message in the holy instant, where all illusions are forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From there the miracle extends to bless everyone and to resolve all problems, be they perceived as great or small, possible or impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is nothing that will not give place to Him and to His Majesty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To join in close relationship with Him is to accept relationships as real, and through their reality to give over all illusions for the reality of your relationship with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Praise be to your relationship with Him and to no other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The truth lies there and nowhere else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You choose this or nothing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"208#12\"><p class=\"p-italic\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgive us our illusions, Father, and help us to accept our true relationship with You, in which there are no illusions, and where none can ever enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Our holiness is Yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What can there be in us that needs forgiveness when Yours is perfect?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The sleep of forgetfulness is only the unwillingness to remember Your forgiveness and Your Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let us not wander into temptation, for the temptation of the Son of God is not Your Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And let us receive only what You have given, and accept but this into the minds which You created and which You love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"208#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Amen.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is impossible to let the past go without relinquishing the special relationship.
