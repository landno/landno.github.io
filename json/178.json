data-sentence-id=\"178#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are blessed and do not know it, you need to learn it must be so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The knowledge is not taught, but its conditions must be acquired for it is they that have been thrown away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can learn to bless, and cannot give what you have not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If, then, you offer blessing, it must have come first to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you must also have accepted it as yours, for how else could you give it away?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is why miracles offer <i>you</i> the testimony that you are blessed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If what you offer is complete forgiveness you must have let guilt go, accepting the Atonement for yourself and learning you are guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How could you learn what has been done for you, unknown to you, unless you do what you would have to do if it <i>had</i> been done for you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"178#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Indirect proof of truth is needed in a world made of denial and without direction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will perceive the need for this if you realize that to deny is the decision not to know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The logic of the world must therefore lead to nothing, for its goal is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you decide to have and give and be nothing except a dream, you must direct your thoughts unto oblivion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And if you have and give and are everything, and all this has been denied, your thought system is closed off and wholly separated from the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This <i>is</i> an insane world, and do not underestimate the extent of its insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no area of your perception that it has not touched, and your dream <i>is</i> sacred to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>That is why God placed the Holy Spirit in you, where you placed the dream.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"178#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Seeing is always outward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Were your thoughts wholly of you, the thought system you made would be forever dark.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The thoughts the mind of God’s Son projects or extends have all the power that he gives to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The thoughts he shares with God are beyond his belief, but those he made <i>are</i> his beliefs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is these, and not the truth, that he has chosen to defend and love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They will not be taken from him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But they can be given up <i>by</i> him, for the Source of their undoing is in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There is nothing in the world to teach him that the logic of the world is totally insane and leads to nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet in him who made this insane logic there is One Who knows it leads to nothing, for He knows everything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"178#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Any direction that would lead you where the Holy Spirit leads you not, goes nowhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Anything you deny that He knows to be true you have denied yourself, and He must therefore teach you not to deny it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Undoing <i>is</i> indirect, as doing is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You were created only to create, neither to see nor do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>These are but indirect expressions of the will to live, which has been blocked by the capricious and unholy whim of death and murder that your Father does not share with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have set yourself the task of sharing what cannot be shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And while you think it possible to learn to do this, you will not believe all that <i>is</i> possible to learn to do.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"178#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit, therefore, must begin His teaching by showing you what you can never learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His message is not indirect, but He must introduce the simple truth into a thought system which has become so twisted and so complex you cannot see that it means nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He merely looks at its foundation and dismisses it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But you who cannot undo what you have made, nor escape the heavy burden of its dullness that lies upon your mind, cannot see through it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It deceives you, because you chose to deceive yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"178#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Those who choose to be deceived will merely attack direct approaches, because they seem to encroach upon deception and strike at it.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"If you are blessed and do not know it, you
