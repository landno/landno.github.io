class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps it is not yet quite clear to you that each decision that you make is one between a grievance and a miracle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each grievance stands like a dark shield of hate before the miracle it would conceal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And as you raise it up before your eyes, you will not see the miracle beyond.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet all the while it waits for you in light, but you behold your grievances instead.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"481#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we go beyond the grievances, to look upon the miracle instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will reverse the way you see by not allowing sight to stop before it sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will not wait before the shield of hate, but lay it down and gently lift our eyes in silence to behold the Son of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"481#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He waits for you behind your grievances, and as you lay them down he will appear in shining light where each one stood before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For every grievance is a block to sight, and as it lifts you see the Son of God where he has always been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He stands in light, but you were in the dark.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each grievance made the darkness deeper, and you could not see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"481#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we will attempt to see God‚Äôs Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will not let ourselves be blind to him; we will not look upon our grievances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>So is the seeing of the world reversed, as we look out toward truth, away from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We will select one person you have used as target for your grievances, and lay the grievances aside and look at him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Someone, perhaps, you fear and even hate; someone you think you love who angered you; someone you call a friend, but whom you see as difficult at times or hard to please, demanding, irritating or untrue to the ideal he should accept as his, according to the role you set for him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"481#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You know the one to choose; his name has crossed your mind already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He will be the one of whom we ask God‚Äôs Son be shown to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Through seeing him behind the grievances that you have held against him, you will learn that what lay hidden while you saw him not is there in everyone, and can be seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He who was enemy is more than friend when he is freed to take the holy role the Holy Spirit has assigned to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let him be savior unto you today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Such is his role in God your Father‚Äôs plan.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"481#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our longer practice periods today will see him in this role.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will attempt to hold him in your mind, first as you now consider him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will review his faults, the difficulties you have had with him, the pain he caused you, his neglect, and all the little and the larger hurts he gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will regard his body with its flaws and better points as well, and you will think of his mistakes and even of his ‚Äúsins.‚Äù</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"481#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Then let us ask of Him Who knows this Son of God in his reality and truth, that we may look on him a different way, and see our savior shining in the light of true forgiveness, given unto us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We ask Him in the holy Name of God and of His Son, as holy as Himself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"481#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let me behold my savior in this one You have appointed as the one for me to ask to lead me to the holy light in which he stands, that I may join with him.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"481#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The body‚Äôs eyes are closed, and as you think of him who grieved you, let your mind be shown the light in him beyond your grievances.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"481#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What you have asked for cannot be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your savior has been waiting long for this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He would be free, and make his freedom yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit leans from him to you, seeing no separation in God‚Äôs Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what you see through Him will free you both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Be very quiet now, and look upon your shining savior.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No dark grievances obscure the sight of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You have allowed the Holy Spirit to express through him the role God gave Him that you might be saved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"481#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God thanks you for these quiet times today in which you laid your images aside, and looked upon the miracle of love the Holy Spirit showed you in their place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world and Heaven join in thanking you, for not one Thought of God but must rejoice as you are saved, and all the world with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"481#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will remember this throughout the day, and take the role assigned to us as part of God‚Äôs salvation plan, and not our own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Temptation falls away when we allow each one we meet to save us, and refuse to hide his light behind our grievances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To everyone you meet, and to the ones you think of or remember from the past, allow the role of savior to be given, that you may share it with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"481#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you both, and all the sightless ones as well, we pray:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"481#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let miracles replace all grievances.</span></p></div>
