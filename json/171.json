data-sentence-id=\"171#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has no buildings and there are no streets where people walk alone and separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There are no stores where people buy an endless list of things they do not need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not lit with artificial light, and night comes not upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no day that brightens and grows dim.</span> <span

must be denied, for sight of it is costing you a different kind of vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span><i>You cannot see both worlds,</i> for each of them involves a different kind of seeing, and depends on what you cherish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The sight of one is possible because you have denied the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Both are not true, yet either one will seem as real to you as the amount to which you hold it dear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And yet their power is not the same, because their real attraction to you is unequal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not really want the world you see, for it has disappointed you since time began.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The homes you built have never sheltered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The roads you made have led you nowhere, and no city that you built has withstood the crumbling assault of time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing you made but has the mark of death upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Hold it not dear, for it is old and tired and ready to return to dust even as you made it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This aching world has not the power to touch the living world at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You could not give it that, and so although you turn in sadness from it, you cannot find in it the road that leads away from it into another world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet the real world has the power to touch you even here, because you love it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what you call with love will come to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Love always answers, being unable to deny a call for help, or not to hear the cries of pain that rise to it from every part of this strange world you made but do not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All that you need to give this world away in glad exchange for what you did not make is willingness to learn the one you made is false.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have been wrong about the world because you have misjudged yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From such a twisted reference point, what could you see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All seeing starts with the perceiver, who judges what is true and what is false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what he judges false he does not see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You who would judge reality cannot see it, for whenever judgment enters reality has slipped away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The out of mind <i>is</i> out of sight, because what is denied is there but is not recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Christ is still there, although you know Him not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>His Being does not depend upon your recognition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He lives within you in the quiet present, and waits for you to leave the past behind and enter into the world He holds out to you in love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one in this distracted world but has seen some glimpses of the other world about him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet while he still lays value on his own, he will deny the vision of the other, maintaining that he loves what he loves not, and following not the road that love points out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Love leads so gladly!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As you follow Him, you will rejoice that you have found His company, and learned of Him the joyful journey home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You wait but for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To give this sad world over and exchange your errors for the peace of God is but <i>your</i> will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And Christ will always offer you the Will of God, in recognition that you share it with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is God’s Will that nothing touch His Son except Himself, and nothing else comes nigh unto him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is as safe from pain as God Himself, Who watches over him in everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world about him shines with love because God placed him in Himself where pain is not, and love surrounds him without end or flaw.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Disturbance of his peace can never be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In perfect sanity he looks on love, for it is all about him and within him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He must deny the world of pain the instant he perceives the arms of love around him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And from this point of safety he looks quietly about him and recognizes that the world is one with him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The peace of God passeth your understanding only in the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet here it <i>is,</i> and you can understand it <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God loves His Son forever, and His Son returns his Father’s Love forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The real world is the way that leads you to remembrance of the one thing that is wholly true and wholly yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For all else you have lent yourself in time, and it will fade.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But this one thing is always yours, being the gift of God unto His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your one reality was given you, and by it God created you as one with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will first dream of peace, and then awaken to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your first exchange of what you made for what you want is the exchange of nightmares for the happy dreams of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In these lie your true perceptions, for the Holy Spirit corrects the world of dreams, where all perception is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Knowledge needs no correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the dreams of love lead unto knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In them you see nothing fearful, and because of this they are the welcome that you offer knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Love waits on welcome, not on time, and the real world is but your welcome of what always was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Therefore the call of joy is in it, and your glad response is your awakening to what you have not lost.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Praise, then, the Father for the perfect sanity of His most holy Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your Father knoweth that you have need of nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In Heaven this is so, for what could you need in eternity?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In your world you do need things.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is a world of scarcity in which you find yourself <i>because</i> you are lacking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet can you find yourself in such a world?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Without the Holy Spirit the answer would be no.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet because of Him the answer is a joyous <i>yes!</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>As Mediator between the two worlds, He knows what you have need of and what will not hurt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Ownership is a dangerous concept if it is left to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The ego wants to have things for salvation, for possession is its law.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Possession for its own sake is the ego’s fundamental creed, a basic cornerstone in the churches it builds to itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#10:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>And at its altar it demands you lay all of the things it bids you get, leaving you no joy in them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everything the ego tells you that you need will hurt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For although the ego urges you again and again to get, it leaves you nothing, for what you get it will demand of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And even from the very hands that grasped it, it will be wrenched and hurled into the dust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For where the ego sees salvation it sees separation, and so you lose whatever you have gotten in its name.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore ask not of yourself what you need, for you do not know, and your advice to yourself will hurt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For what you think you need will merely serve to tighten up your world against the light, and render you unwilling to question the value that this world can really hold for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only the Holy Spirit knows what you need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For He will give you all things that do not block the way to light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what else could you need?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In time, He gives you all the things that you need have, and will renew them as long as you have need of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He will take nothing from you as long as you have any need of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And yet He knows that everything you need is temporary, and will but last until you step aside from all your needs and realize that all of them have been fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Therefore He has no investment in the things that He supplies, except to make certain that you will not use them on behalf of lingering in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He knows that you are not at home there, and He wills no delay to wait upon your joyous homecoming.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Leave, then, your needs to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He will supply them with no emphasis at all upon them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What comes to you of Him comes safely, for He will ensure it never can become a dark spot, hidden in your mind and kept to hurt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Under His guidance you will travel light and journey lightly, for His sight is ever on the journey’s end, which is His goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s Son is not a traveller through outer worlds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>However holy his perception may become, no world outside himself holds his inheritance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Within himself he has no needs, for light needs nothing but to shine in peace, and from itself to let the rays extend in quiet to infinity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you are tempted to undertake a useless journey that would lead away from light, remember what you really want, and say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"171#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit leads me unto Christ, and where else would I go?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What need have I but to awake in Him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Then follow Him in joy, with faith that He will lead you safely through all dangers to your peace of mind this world may set before you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Kneel not before the altars to sacrifice, and seek not what you will surely lose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Content yourself with what you will as surely keep, and be not restless, for you undertake a quiet journey to the peace of God, where He would have you be in quietness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#16:1\"><span class=\"snr

quietness that is the gift of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Hold me dear, for what except your brothers can you need?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We will restore to you the peace of mind that we must find together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit will teach you to awaken unto us and to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the only real need to be fulfilled in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#16:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Salvation from the world lies only here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#16:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>My peace I give you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#16:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Take it of me in glad exchange for all the world has offered but to take away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#16:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And we will spread it like a veil of light across the world’s sad face, in which we hide our brothers from the world, and it from them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"171#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We cannot sing redemption’s hymn alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>My task is not completed until I have lifted every voice with mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And yet it is not mine, for as it is my gift to you, so was it the Father’s gift to me, given me through His Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The sound of it will banish sorrow from the mind of God’s most holy Son, where it cannot abide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Healing in time is needed, for joy cannot establish its eternal reign where sorrow dwells.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#17:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You dwell not here, but in eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#17:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You travel but in dreams, while safe at home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#17:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Give thanks to every part of you that you have taught how to remember you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"171#17:9\"><span
