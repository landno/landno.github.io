105"},"annotation":"W-105","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text lesson-105\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"509#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God‚Äôs peace and joy are yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today we will accept them, knowing they belong to us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And we will try to understand these gifts increase as we receive them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are not like to the gifts the world can give, in which the giver loses as he gives the gift; the taker is the richer by his loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Such are not gifts, but bargains made with guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The truly given gift entails no loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is impossible that one can gain because another loses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This implies a limit and an insufficiency.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"509#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No gift is given thus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Such ‚Äúgifts‚Äù are but a bid for a more valuable return; a loan with interest to be paid in full; a temporary lending, meant to be a pledge of debt to be repaid with more than was received by him who took the gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This strange distortion of what giving means pervades all levels of the world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It strips all meaning from the gifts you give, and leaves you nothing in the ones you take.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"509#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A major learning goal this course has set is to reverse your view of giving, so you can receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For giving has become a source of fear, and so you would avoid the only means by which you can receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Accept God‚Äôs peace and joy, and you will learn a different way of looking at a gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God‚Äôs gifts will never lessen when they are given away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They but increase thereby.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"509#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As Heaven‚Äôs peace and joy intensify when you accept them as God‚Äôs gift to you, so does the joy of your Creator grow when you accept His joy and peace as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>True giving is creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It extends the limitless to the unlimited, eternity to timelessness, and love unto itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It adds to all that is complete already, not in simple terms of adding more, for that implies that it was less before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It adds by letting what cannot contain itself fulfill its aim of giving everything it has away, securing it forever for itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"509#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today accept God‚Äôs peace and joy as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let Him complete Himself as He defines completion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will understand that what completes Him must complete His Son as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He cannot give through loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No more can you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Receive His gift of joy and peace today, and He will thank you for your gift to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"509#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today our practice periods will start a little differently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Begin today by thinking of those brothers who have been denied by you the peace and joy that are their right under the equal laws of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here you denied them to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And here you must return to claim them as your own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"509#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think of your ‚Äúenemies‚Äù a little while, and tell each one, as he occurs to you:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"509#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>My brother, peace and joy I offer you, that I may have God‚Äôs peace and joy as mine.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"509#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus you prepare yourself to recognize God‚Äôs gifts to you, and let your mind be free of all that would prevent success today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now are you ready to accept the gift of peace and joy that God has given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now are you ready to experience the joy and peace you have denied yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Now you can say, ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs peace and joy are mine,‚Äù for you have given what you would receive.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"509#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You must succeed today, if you prepare your mind as we suggest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you have let all bars to peace and joy be lifted up, and what is yours can come to you at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>So tell yourself, ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs peace and joy are mine,‚Äù and close your eyes a while, and let His Voice assure you that the words you speak are true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"509#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Spend your five minutes thus with Him each time you can today, but do not think that less is worthless when you cannot give Him more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>At least remember hourly to say the words which call to Him to give you what He wills to give, and wills you to receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Determine not to interfere today with what He wills.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if a brother seems to tempt you to deny God‚Äôs gift to him, see it as but another chance to let yourself receive the gifts of God as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"509#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Then bless your brother thankfully, and say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"509#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>My brother, peace and joy I offer you, that I may have God‚Äôs peace and joy as mine.</span></p></div>
