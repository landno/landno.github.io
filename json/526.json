data-sentence-id=\"526#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the answer to your search for peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is the key to meaning in a world that seems to make no sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here is the way to safety in apparent dangers that appear to threaten you at every turn, and bring uncertainty to all your hopes of ever finding quietness and peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here are all questions answered; here the end of all uncertainty ensured at last.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The unforgiving mind is full of fear, and offers love no room to be itself; no place where it can spread its wings in peace and soar above the turmoil of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The unforgiving mind is sad, without the hope of respite and release from pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It suffers and abides in misery, peering about in darkness, seeing not, yet certain of the danger lurking there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The unforgiving mind is torn with doubt, confused about itself and all it sees; afraid and angry, weak and blustering, afraid to go ahead, afraid to stay, afraid to waken or to go to sleep, afraid of every sound, yet more afraid of stillness; terrified of darkness, yet more terrified at the approach of light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What can the unforgiving mind perceive but its damnation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What can it behold except the proof that all its sins are real?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The unforgiving mind sees no mistakes, but only sins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It looks upon the world with sightless eyes, and shrieks as it beholds its own projections rising to attack its miserable parody of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It wants to live, yet wishes it were dead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It wants forgiveness, yet it sees no hope.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It wants escape, yet can conceive of none because it sees the sinful everywhere.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The unforgiving mind is in despair, without the prospect of a future which can offer anything but more despair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it regards its judgment of the world as irreversible, and does not see it has condemned itself to this despair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It thinks it cannot change, for what it sees bears witness that its judgment is correct.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not ask, because it thinks it knows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It does not question, certain it is right.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness is acquired.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not inherent in the mind, which cannot sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As sin is an idea you taught yourself, forgiveness must be learned by you as well, but from a Teacher other than yourself, Who represents the other Self in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Through Him you learn how to forgive the self you think you made, and let it disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus you return your mind as one to Him Who is your Self, and Who can never sin.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Each unforgiving mind presents you with an opportunity to teach your own how to forgive itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each one awaits release from hell through you, and turns to you imploringly for Heaven here and now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It has no hope, but you become its hope.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And as its hope, do you become your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The unforgiving mind must learn through your forgiveness that it has been saved from hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And as you teach salvation, you will learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet all your teaching and your learning will be not of you, but of the Teacher Who was given you to show the way to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we practice learning to forgive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you are willing, you can learn today to take the key to happiness, and use it on your own behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will devote ten minutes in the morning, and at night another ten, to learning how to give forgiveness and receive forgiveness, too.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The unforgiving mind does not believe that giving and receiving are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet we will try to learn today that they are one through practicing forgiveness toward one whom you think of as an enemy, and one whom you consider as a friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And as you learn to see them both as one, we will extend the lesson to yourself, and see that their escape included yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin the longer practice periods by thinking of someone you do not like, who seems to irritate you, or to cause regret in you if you should meet him; one you actively despise, or merely try to overlook.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not matter what the form your anger takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You probably have chosen him already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He will do.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now close your eyes and see him in your mind, and look at him a while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try to perceive some light in him somewhere; a little gleam which you had never noticed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Try to find some little spark of brightness shining through the ugly picture that you hold of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Look at this picture till you see a light somewhere within it, and then try to let this light extend until it covers him, and makes the picture beautiful and good.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Look at this changed perception for a while, and turn your mind to one you call a friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try to transfer the light you learned to see around your former “enemy” to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Perceive him now as more than friend to you, for in that light his holiness shows you your savior, saved and saving, healed and whole.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"526#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Then let him offer you the light you see in him, and let your “enemy” and friend unite in blessing you with what you gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now are you one with them, and they with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Now have you been forgiven by yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not forget, throughout the day, the role forgiveness plays in bringing happiness to every unforgiving mind, with yours among them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Every hour tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"526#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Forgiveness is the key to happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"526#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I will awaken from the dream that I am mortal, fallible and full of sin, and know I am the perfect Son of God.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Here is the answer to your search for peace.
