data-sentence-id=\"401#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A theoretical foundation such as the text provides is necessary as a framework to make the exercises in this workbook meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it is doing the exercises that will make the goal of the course possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>An untrained mind can accomplish nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the purpose of this workbook to train your mind to think along the lines the text sets forth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"401#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The exercises are very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They do not require a great deal of time, and it does not matter where you do them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They need no preparation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The training period is one year.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The exercises are numbered from 1 to 365.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not undertake to do more than one set of exercises a day.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"401#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The workbook is divided into two main sections, the first dealing with the undoing of the way you see now, and the second with the acquisition of true perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>With the exception of the review periods, each day‚Äôs exercises are planned around one central idea, which is stated first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is followed by a description of the specific procedures by which the idea for the day is to be applied.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"401#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The purpose of the workbook is to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The exercises are planned to help you generalize the lessons, so that you will understand that each of them is equally applicable to everyone and everything you see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"401#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Transfer of training in true perception does not proceed as does transfer of the training of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If true perception has been achieved in connection with any person, situation or event, total transfer to everyone and everything is certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>On the other hand, one exception held apart from true perception makes its accomplishments anywhere impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"401#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The only general rules to be observed throughout, then, are: First, that the exercises be practiced with great specificity, as will be indicated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This will help you to generalize the ideas involved to every situation in which you find yourself, and to everyone and everything in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Second, be sure that you do not decide for yourself that there are some people, situations or things to which the ideas are inapplicable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This will interfere with transfer of training.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The very nature of true perception is that it has no limits.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is the opposite of the way you see now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"401#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The overall aim of the exercises is to increase your ability to extend the ideas you will be practicing to include everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This will require no effort on your part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The exercises themselves meet the conditions necessary for this kind of transfer.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"401#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Some of the ideas the workbook presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are not asked to judge them at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are asked only to use them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"401#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember only this; you need not believe the ideas, you need not accept them, and you need not even welcome them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Some of them you may actively resist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>None of this will matter, or decrease their efficacy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But do not allow yourself to make exceptions in applying the ideas the workbook contains, and whatever your reactions to the ideas may be, use them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"401#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothing more than that is required.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"A theoretical foundation such as the text provides is necessary as a framework to make the exercises in
