truth in you, whose vision sees beyond appearances to that same truth in everyone and everything there is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here is the end of suffering for all the world, and everyone who ever came and yet will come to linger for a while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here is the thought in which the

remains completely undisturbed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yours is the rest of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#4:4\"><span

you because you rest in God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They will not hear another voice than yours because you gave your voice to God, and now you rest in Him and let Him speak through you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"513#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#5:1\"><span class=\"snr

class=\"snr\">2</span>In timelessness you rest, while time goes by without its touch upon you, for your rest can never change in any way at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You rest today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And as you close your eyes, sink into stillness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let these periods of rest and respite reassure your mind that all its frantic fantasies were but the dreams of fever that has passed away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let it be still and thankfully accept its healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No more fearful dreams will come, now that you rest in God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Take time today to slip away from dreams and into peace.</span></p></div>

tired mind is suddenly made glad, a bird with broken wings begins to sing, a stream long dry begins to flow again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world is born again each time you rest, and hourly remember that you came to bring the peace of God into the world, that it might take its rest along with you.</span></p></div> <div

world is nearer waking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And the time when rest will be the only thing there is comes closer to all worn and tired minds, too weary now to go their way alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And they will hear the bird begin to sing and see the stream begin to flow again, with hope reborn and energy restored to walk with lightened steps along the road that suddenly seems easy as they go.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"513#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You rest within the peace of God today, and call upon your brothers from your rest to draw them to their rest, along with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will be faithful to your trust today, forgetting no one, bringing everyone into the boundless circle of your peace, the holy sanctuary where you rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Open the temple doors and let them come from far across the world, and near as well; your distant brothers and your closest friends; bid them all enter here and rest with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"513#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You rest within the peace of God today, quiet and unafraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each brother comes to take his rest, and offer it to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We rest together here, for thus our rest is made complete, and what we give today we have received already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Time is not the guardian of what we give today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"513#9:5\"><span
