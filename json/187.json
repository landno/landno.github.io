data-sentence-id=\"187#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When no perception stands between God and His creations, or between His children and their own, the knowledge of creation must continue forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The reflections you accept into the mirror of your mind in time but bring eternity nearer or farther.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But eternity itself is beyond all time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Reach out of time and touch it, with the help of its reflection in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you will turn from time to holiness, as surely as the reflection of holiness calls everyone to lay all guilt aside.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Reflect the peace of Heaven here, and bring this world to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For the reflection of truth draws everyone to truth, and as they enter into it they leave all reflections behind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In Heaven reality is shared and not reflected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>By sharing its reflection here, its truth becomes the only perception the Son of God accepts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus, remembrance of his Father dawns on him, and he can no longer be satisfied with anything but his own reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You on earth have no conception of limitlessness, for the world you seem to live in is a world of limits.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In this world, it is not true that anything without order of difficulty can occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The miracle, therefore, has a unique function, and is motivated by a unique Teacher Who brings the laws of another world to this one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The miracle is the one thing you can do that transcends order, being based not on differences but on equality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Miracles are not in competition, and the number of them that you can do is limitless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They can be simultaneous and legion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is not difficult to understand, once you conceive of them as possible at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is more difficult to grasp is the lack of order of difficulty that stamps the miracle as something that must come from elsewhere, not from here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>From the world’s viewpoint, this is impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps you have been aware of lack of competition among your thoughts, which even though they may conflict, can occur together and in great numbers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may indeed be so used to this that it causes you little surprise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you are also used to classifying some of your thoughts as more important, larger or better, wiser, or more productive and valuable than others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is true of the thoughts that cross the mind of those who think they live apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For some are reflections of Heaven, while others are motivated by the ego, which but seems to think.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The result is a weaving, changing pattern that never rests and is never still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It shifts unceasingly across the mirror of your mind, and the reflections of Heaven last but a moment and grow dim, as darkness blots them out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Where there was light, darkness removes it in an instant, and alternating patterns of light and darkness sweep constantly across your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The little sanity that still remains is held together by a sense of order that you establish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the very fact that you can do this, and bring any order into chaos shows you that you are not an ego, and that more than an ego must be in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the ego <i>is</i> chaos, and if it were all of you, no order at all would be possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet though the order you impose upon your mind limits the ego, it also limits you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To order is to judge, and to arrange by judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Therefore it is not your function, but the Holy Spirit’s.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It will seem difficult for you to learn that you have no basis at all for ordering your thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This lesson the Holy Spirit teaches by giving you the shining examples of miracles to show you that your way of ordering is wrong, but that a better way is offered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The miracle offers exactly the same response to every call for help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not judge the call.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It merely recognizes what it is, and answers accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It does not consider which call is louder or greater or more important.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You may wonder how you who are still bound to judgment can be asked to do that which requires no judgment of your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The answer is very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The power of God, and not of you, engenders miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The miracle itself is but the witness that you have the power of God in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>That is the reason why the miracle gives equal blessing to all who share in it, and that is also why everyone shares in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The power of God is limitless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>And being always maximal, it offers everything to every call from anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>There is no order of difficulty here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#6:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>A call for help is given help.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The only judgment involved is the Holy Spirit’s one division into two categories; one of love, and the other the call for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot safely make this division, for you are much too confused either to recognize love, or to believe that everything else is nothing but a call for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are too bound to form, and not to content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you consider content is not content at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is merely form, and nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For you do not respond to what a brother really offers you, but only to the particular perception of his offering by which the ego judges it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is incapable of understanding content, and is totally unconcerned with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To the ego, if the form is acceptable the content must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Otherwise it will attack the form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you believe you understand something of the “dynamics” of the ego, let me assure you that you understand nothing of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For of yourself you could not understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The study of the ego is not the study of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In fact, the ego enjoys studying itself, and thoroughly approves the undertakings of students who would “analyze” it, thus approving its importance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet they but study form with meaningless content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For their teacher is senseless, though careful to conceal this fact behind impressive sounding words, but which lack any consistent sense when they are put together.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is characteristic of the ego’s judgments.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Separately, they seem to hold, but put them together and the system of thought that arises from joining them is incoherent and utterly chaotic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For form is not enough for meaning, and the underlying lack of content makes a cohesive system impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Separation therefore remains the ego’s chosen condition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For no one alone can judge the ego truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet when two or more join together in searching for truth, the ego can no longer defend its lack of content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The fact of union tells them it is not true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible to remember God in secret and alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For remembering Him means you are not alone, and are willing to remember it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Take no thought for yourself, for no thought you hold <i>is</i> for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you would remember your Father, let the Holy Spirit order your thoughts and give only the answer with which He answers you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everyone seeks for love as you do, but knows it not unless he joins with you in seeking it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you undertake the search together, you bring with you a light so powerful that what you see is given meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The lonely journey fails because it has excluded what it would find.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As God communicates to the Holy Spirit in you, so does the Holy Spirit translate His communications through you, so you can understand them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God has no secret communications, for everything of Him is perfectly open and freely accessible to all, being for all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing lives in secret, and what you would hide from the Holy Spirit is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Every interpretation you would lay upon a brother is senseless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let the Holy Spirit show him to you, and teach you both his love and his call for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Neither his mind nor yours holds more than these two orders of thought.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"187#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle is the recognition that this is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Where there is love, your brother must give it to you because of what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But where there is a call for love, you must give it because of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Earlier I said this course will teach you how to remember what you are, restoring to you your Identity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We have already learned that this Identity is shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The miracle becomes the means of sharing It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>By supplying your Identity wherever It is not recognized, you will recognize It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And God Himself, Who wills to be with His Son forever, will bless each recognition of His Son with all the Love He holds for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nor will the power of all His Love be absent from any miracle you offer to His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"187#12:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>How, then, can there be any order of difficulty among them?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"When no perception stands between God and His creations, or between His children and their own, the knowledge of creation
