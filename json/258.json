data-sentence-id=\"258#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do you not see that all your misery comes from the strange belief that you are powerless?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Being helpless is the cost of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Helplessness is sin’s condition; the one requirement that it demands to be believed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only the helpless could believe in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Enormity has no appeal save to the little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And only those who first believe that they are little could see attraction there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Treachery to the Son of God is the defense of those who do not identify with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you are for him or against him; either you love him or attack him, protect his unity or see him shattered and slain by your attack.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one believes the Son of God is powerless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And those who see themselves as helpless must believe that they are not the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What can they be except his enemy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what can they do but envy him his power, and by their envy make themselves afraid of it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>These are the dark ones, silent and afraid, alone and not communicating, fearful the power of the Son of God will strike them dead, and raising up their helplessness against him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They join the army of the powerless, to wage their war of vengeance, bitterness and spite on him, to make him one with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Because they do not know that they <i>are</i> one with him, they know not whom they hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They are indeed a sorry army, each one as likely to attack his brother or turn upon himself as to remember that they thought they had a common cause.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Frantic and loud and strong the dark ones seem to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet they know not their “enemy,” except they hate him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In hatred they have come together, but have not joined each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For had they done so hatred would be impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The army of the powerless must be disbanded in the presence of strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Those who are strong are never treacherous, because they have no need to dream of power and to act out their dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How would an army act in dreams?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Any way at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It could be seen attacking anyone with anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Dreams have no reason in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>A flower turns into a poisoned spear, a child becomes a giant and a mouse roars like a lion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And love is turned to hate as easily.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>This is no army, but a madhouse.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#3:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>What seems to be a planned attack is bedlam.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The army of the powerless is weak indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has no weapons and it has no enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yes, it can overrun the world and <i>seek</i> an enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But it can never find what is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yes, it can <i>dream</i> it found an enemy, but this will shift even as it attacks, so that it runs at once to find another, and never comes to rest in victory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And as it runs it turns against itself, thinking it caught a glimpse of the great enemy who always eludes its murderous attack by turning into something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How treacherous does this enemy appear, who changes so it is impossible even to recognize him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet hate must have a target.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There can be no faith in sin without an enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who that believes in sin would dare believe he has no enemy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Could he admit that no one made him powerless?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Reason would surely bid him seek no longer what is not there to find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet first he must be willing to perceive a world where it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is not necessary that he understand how he can see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nor should he try.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For if he focuses on what he cannot understand, he will but emphasize his helplessness, and let sin tell him that his enemy must be himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But let him only ask himself these questions, which he must decide, to have it done for him:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Do I desire a world I rule instead of one that rules me?<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Do I desire a world where I am powerful instead of helpless?<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Do I desire a world in which I have no enemies and cannot sin?<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#5:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>And do I want to see what I denied <b>because</b> it is the truth?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may already have answered the first three questions, but not yet the last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this one still seems fearful, and unlike the others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet reason would assure you they are all the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We said this year would emphasize the sameness of things that are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This final question, which is indeed the last you need decide, still seems to hold a threat the rest have lost for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And this imagined difference attests to your belief that truth may be the enemy you yet may find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here, then, would seem to be the last remaining hope of finding sin, and not accepting power.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forget not that the choice of sin or truth, helplessness or power, is the choice of whether to attack or heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For healing comes of power, and attack of helplessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whom you attack you <i>cannot</i> want to heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And whom you would have healed must be the one you chose to be protected from attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what is this decision but the choice whether to see him through the body’s eyes, or let him be revealed to you through vision?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How this decision leads to its effects is not your problem.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But what you want to see must be your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is a course in cause and not effect.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Consider carefully your answer to the last question you have left unanswered still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And let your reason tell you that it must be answered, and is answered in the other three.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And then it will be clear to you that, as you look on the effects of sin in any form, all you need do is simply ask yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"258#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is this what I would see?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do I want this?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is your one decision; this the condition for what occurs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is irrelevant to how it happens, but not to why.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You <i>have</i> control of this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if you choose to see a world without an enemy, in which you are not helpless, the means to see it will be given you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why is the final question so important?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Reason will tell you why.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the same as are the other three, except in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The others are decisions that can be made, and then unmade and made again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But truth is constant, and implies a state where vacillations are impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can desire a world you rule that rules you not, and change your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You can desire to exchange your helplessness for power, and lose this same desire as a little glint of sin attracts you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you can want to see a sinless world, and let an “enemy” tempt you to use the body’s eyes and change what you desire.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In content all the questions are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For each one asks if you are willing to exchange the world of sin for what the Holy Spirit sees, since it is this the world of sin denies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And therefore those who look on sin are seeing the denial of the real world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the last question adds the wish for constancy in your desire to see the real world, so the desire becomes the only one you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>By answering the final question “yes,” you add sincerity to the decisions you have already made to all the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For only then have you renounced the option to change your mind again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When it is this you do not want, the rest are wholly answered.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why do you think you are unsure the others have been answered?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Could it be necessary they be asked so often, if they had?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Until the last decision has been made, the answer is both “yes” and “no.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you have answered “yes” without perceiving that “yes” must mean “not no.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one decides against his happiness, but he may do so if he does not see he does it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if he sees his happiness as ever changing, now this, now that, and now an elusive shadow attached to nothing, he does decide against it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"258#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Elusive happiness, or happiness in changing form that shifts with time and place, is an illusion that has no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Happiness must be constant, because it is attained by giving up the wish for the <i>in</i>constant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Joy cannot be perceived except through constant vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And constant vision can be given only those who wish for constancy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The power of the Son of God’s desire remains the proof that he is wrong who sees himself as helpless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Desire what you want, and you will look on it and think it real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No thought but has the power to release or kill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"258#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And none can leave the thinker’s mind, or leave him unaffected.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Do you not see that
