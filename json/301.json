be understood before the purpose of the course can be accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let us review the principles that we have covered, and arrange

from separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When the separation is denied, it goes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it is gone as soon as the idea that brought it has been healed, and been replaced by sanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Sickness and sin are seen as consequence and cause, in a relationship kept hidden from awareness that it may be carefully preserved from reason’s light.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Guilt asks for punishment, and its request is granted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Not in truth, but in the world of shadows and illusions built on sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Son of God perceived what he would see because perception is a wish fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perception changes, made to take the place of changeless knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet is truth unchanged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It cannot be perceived, but only known.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What is perceived takes many forms, but none has meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Brought to truth, its senselessness is quite apparent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Kept apart from truth, it seems to have a meaning and be real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perception’s laws are opposite to truth, and what is true of knowledge is not true of anything that is apart from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet has God given answer to the world of sickness, which applies to all its forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s answer is eternal, though it works in time, where it is needed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet because it is of God, the laws of time do not affect its workings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is in this world, but not a part of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For it is real, and dwells where all reality must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Ideas leave not their source, and their effects but seem to be apart from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Ideas are of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What is projected out, and seems to be external to the mind, is not outside at all, but an effect of what is in, and has not left its source.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s answer lies where the belief in sin must be, for only there can its effects be utterly undone and without cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perception’s laws must be reversed, because they <i>are</i> reversals of the laws of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The laws of truth forever will be true, and cannot be reversed; yet can be seen as upside down.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And this must be corrected where the illusion of reversal lies.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible that one illusion be less amenable to truth than are the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But it is possible that some are given greater value, and less willingly offered to truth for healing and for help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No illusion has any truth in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it appears some are more true than others, although this clearly makes no sense at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All that a hierarchy of illusions can show is preference, not reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What relevance has preference to the truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Illusions are illusions and are false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your preference gives them no reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Not one is true in any way, and all must yield with equal ease to what God gave as answer to them all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God’s Will is One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And any wish that seems to go against His Will has no foundation in the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sin is not error, for it goes beyond correction to impossibility.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the belief that it is real has made some errors seem forever past the hope of healing, and the lasting grounds for hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If this were so, would Heaven be opposed by its own opposite, as real as it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then would God’s Will be split in two, and all creation be subjected to the laws of two opposing powers, until God becomes impatient, splits the world apart, and relegates attack unto Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus has He lost His Mind, proclaiming sin has taken His reality from Him and brought His Love at last to vengeance’s heels.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For such an insane picture an insane defense can be expected, but can not establish that the picture must be true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing gives meaning where no meaning is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And truth needs no defense to make it true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Illusions have no witnesses and no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who looks on them is but deceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forgiveness is the only function here, and serves to bring the joy this world denies to every aspect of God’s Son where sin was thought to rule.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perhaps you do not see the role forgiveness plays in ending death and all beliefs that rise from mists of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Sins are beliefs that you impose between your brother and yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They limit you to time and place, and give a little space to you, another little space to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This separating off is symbolized, in your perception, by a body which is clearly separate and a thing apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet what this symbol represents is but your wish to <i>be</i> apart and separate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness takes away what stands between your brother and yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the wish that you be joined with him, and not apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We call it “wish” because it still conceives of other choices, and has not yet reached beyond the world of choice entirely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet is this wish in line with Heaven’s state, and not in opposition to God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Although it falls far short of giving you your full inheritance, it does remove the obstacles that you have placed between the Heaven where you are, and recognition of where and what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Facts are unchanged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet facts can be denied and thus unknown, though they were known before they were denied.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation, perfect and complete, asks but a little wish that what is true be true; a little willingness to overlook what is not there; a little sigh that speaks for Heaven as a preference to this world that death and desolation seem to rule.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In joyous answer will creation rise within you, to replace the world you see with Heaven, wholly perfect and complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What is forgiveness but a willingness that truth be true?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What can remain unhealed and broken from a unity which holds all things within itself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And every miracle is possible the instant that the Son of God perceives his wishes and the Will of God are one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is the Will of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He wills His Son have everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this He guaranteed when He created him <i>as</i> everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is impossible that anything be lost, if what you <i>have</i> is what you <i>are.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the miracle by which creation became your function, sharing it with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is not understood apart from Him, and therefore has no meaning in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here does the Son of God ask not too much, but far too little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He would sacrifice his own identity with everything, to find a little treasure of his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And this he cannot do without a sense of isolation, loss and loneliness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This is the treasure he has sought to find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And he could only be afraid of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Is fear a treasure?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Can uncertainty be what you want?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#11:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>Or is it a mistake about your will, and what you really are?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us consider what the error is, so it can be corrected, not protected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Sin is belief attack can be projected outside the mind where the belief arose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here is the firm conviction that ideas can leave their source made real and meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And from this error does the world of sin and sacrifice arise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This world is an attempt to prove your innocence, while cherishing attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Its failure lies in that you still feel guilty, though without understanding why.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Effects are seen as separate from their source, and seem to be beyond you to control or to prevent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What is thus kept apart can never join.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Cause and effect are one, not separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God wills you learn what always has been true: that He created you as part of Him, and this must still be true because ideas leave not their source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Such is creation’s law; that each idea the mind conceives but adds to its abundance, never takes away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is as true of what is idly wished as what is truly willed, because the mind can wish to be deceived, but cannot make it be what it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And to believe ideas can leave their source is to invite illusions to be true, without success.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For never will success be possible in trying to deceive the Son of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle is possible when cause and consequence are brought together, not kept separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The healing of effect without the cause can merely shift effects to other forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this is not release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God’s Son could never be content with less than full salvation and escape from guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For otherwise he still demands that he must make some sacrifice, and thus denies that everything is his, unlimited by loss of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A tiny sacrifice is just the same in its effects as is the whole idea of sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If loss in any form is possible, then is God’s Son made incomplete and not himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nor will he know himself, nor recognize his will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#14:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He has forsworn his Father and himself, and made Them both his enemies in hate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Illusions serve the purpose they were made to serve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And from their purpose they derive whatever meaning that they seem to have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God gave to all illusions that were made another purpose that would justify a miracle whatever form they took.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In every miracle all healing lies, for God gave answer to them all as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what is one to Him must be the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you believe what is the same is different you but deceive yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What God calls one will be forever one, not separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#15:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>His Kingdom is united; thus it was created, and thus will it ever be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"301#16\"><p

data-sentence-id=\"301#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Heaven is shining on the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Deny him not, that you may be released.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each instant is the Son of God reborn until he chooses not to die again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In every wish to hurt he chooses death instead of what his Father wills for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"301#16:7\"><span
