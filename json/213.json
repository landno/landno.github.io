data-sentence-id=\"213#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God established His relationship with you to make you happy, and nothing you do that does not share His purpose can be real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The purpose God ascribed to anything is its only function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Because of His reason for creating His relationship with you, the function of relationships became forever “to make happy.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span><i>And nothing else.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To fulfill this function you relate to your creations as God to His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For nothing God created is apart from happiness, and nothing God created but would extend happiness as its Creator did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Whatever does not fulfill this function cannot be real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this world it is impossible to create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it <i>is</i> possible to make happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have said repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would transform them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And all that is meant by that is that He will restore to them the function given them by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The function you have given them is clearly not to make happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But the holy relationship shares God’s purpose, rather than aiming to make a substitute for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Every special relationship you have made is a substitute for God’s Will, and glorifies yours instead of His because of the illusion that they are different.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have made very real relationships even in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you do not recognize them because you have raised their substitutes to such predominance that, when truth calls to you, as it does constantly, you answer with a substitute.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every special relationship you have made has, as its fundamental purpose, the aim of occupying your mind so completely that you will not hear the call of truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In a sense, the special relationship was the ego’s answer to the creation of the Holy Spirit, Who was God’s Answer to the separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For although the ego did not understand what had been created, it was aware of threat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The whole defense system the ego evolved to protect the separation from the Holy Spirit was in response to the gift with which God blessed it, and by His blessing enabled it to be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This blessing holds within itself the truth about everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And the truth is that the Holy Spirit is in close relationship with you, because in Him is your relationship with God restored to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The relationship with Him has never been broken, because the Holy Spirit has not been separate from anyone since the separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And through Him have all your holy relationships been carefully preserved, to serve God’s purpose for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is always alert to threat, and the part of your mind into which the ego was accepted is very anxious to preserve its reason, as it sees it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not realize that it is totally insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you must realize just what this means if you would be restored to sanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The insane protect their thought systems, but they do so insanely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And all their defenses are as insane as what they are supposed to protect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The separation has nothing in it, no part, no “reason,” and no attribute that is not insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And its “protection” is part of it, as insane as the whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The special relationship, which is its chief defense, must therefore be insane.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have but little difficulty now in realizing that the thought system the special relationship protects is but a system of delusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You recognize, at least in general terms, that the ego is insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet the special relationship still seems to you somehow to be “different.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet we have looked at it far closer than we have at many other aspects of the ego’s thought system that you have been more willing to let go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>While this one remains, you will not let the others go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For this one is not different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Retain this one, and you have retained the whole.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is essential to realize that all defenses <i>do</i> what they would defend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The underlying basis for their effectiveness is that they offer what they defend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What they defend is placed in them for safe-keeping, and as they operate they bring it to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Every defense operates by giving gifts, and the gift is always a miniature of the thought system the defense protects, set in a golden frame.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The frame is very elaborate, all set with jewels, and deeply carved and polished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Its purpose is to be of value <i>in itself,</i> and to divert your attention from what it encloses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But the frame without the picture you cannot have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Defenses operate to make you think you can.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The special relationship has the most imposing and deceptive frame of all the defenses the ego uses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its thought system is offered here, surrounded by a frame so heavy and so elaborate that the picture is almost obliterated by its imposing structure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Into the frame are woven all sorts of fanciful and fragmented illusions of love, set with dreams of sacrifice and self-aggrandizement, and interlaced with gilded threads of self-destruction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The glitter of blood shines like rubies, and the tears are faceted like diamonds and gleam in the dim light in which the offering is made.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Look at the <i>picture.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not let the frame distract you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This gift is given you for your damnation, and if you take it you will believe that you <i>are</i> damned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot have the frame without the picture.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you value is the frame, for there you see no conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet the frame is only the wrapping for the gift of conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The frame is not the gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Be not deceived by the most superficial aspects of this thought system, for these aspects enclose the whole, complete in every aspect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Death lies in this glittering gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Let not your gaze dwell on the hypnotic gleaming of the frame.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Look at the picture, and realize that death is offered you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That is why the holy instant is so important in the defense of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The truth itself needs no defense, but you do need defense against your acceptance of the gift of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you who are truth accept an idea so dangerous to truth, you threaten truth with destruction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And your defense must now be undertaken, to keep truth whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The power of Heaven, the Love of God, the tears of Christ, and the joy of His eternal Spirit are marshalled to defend you from your own attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For you attack Them, being part of Them, and They must save you, for They love Themselves.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant is a miniature of Heaven, sent you <i>from</i> Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a picture, too, set in a frame.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet if you accept this gift you will not see the frame at all, because the gift can only be accepted through your willingness to focus all your attention on the picture.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The holy instant is a miniature of eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is a picture of timelessness, set in a frame of time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you focus on the picture, you will realize that it was only the frame that made you think it <i>was</i> a picture.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Without the frame, the picture is seen as what it represents.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For as the whole thought system of the ego lies in its gifts, so the whole of Heaven lies in this instant, borrowed from eternity and set in time for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Two gifts are offered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each is complete, and cannot be partially accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each is a picture of all that you can have, seen very differently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot compare their value by comparing a picture to a frame.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It must be the pictures only that you compare, or the comparison is wholly without meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Remember that it is the picture that is the gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And only on this basis are you really free to choose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Look at the pictures.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Both of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>One is a tiny picture, hard to see at all beneath the heavy shadows of its enormous and disproportionate enclosure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#12:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The other is lightly framed and hung in light, lovely to look upon for what it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who have tried so hard, and are still trying, to fit the better picture into the wrong frame and so combine what cannot be combined, accept this and be glad: These pictures are each framed perfectly for what they represent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>One is framed to be out of focus and not seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The other is framed for perfect clarity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The picture of darkness and of death grows less convincing as you search it out amid its wrappings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As each senseless stone that seems to shine from the frame in darkness is exposed to light, it becomes dull and lifeless, and ceases to distract you from the picture.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And finally you look upon the picture itself, seeing at last that, unprotected by the frame, it has no meaning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The other picture is lightly framed, for time cannot contain eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no distraction here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The picture of Heaven and eternity grows more convincing as you look at it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And now, by real comparison, a transformation of both pictures can at last occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And each is given its rightful place when both are seen in relation to each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The dark picture, brought to light, is not perceived as fearful, but the fact that it is just a picture is brought home at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And what you see there you will recognize as what it is; a picture of what you thought was real, and nothing more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For beyond this picture you will see nothing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The picture of light, in clear-cut and unmistakable contrast, is transformed into what lies beyond the picture.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As you look on this, you realize that it is not a picture, but a reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is no figured representation of a thought system, but the Thought itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What it represents is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The frame fades gently and God rises to your remembrance, offering you the whole of creation in exchange for your little picture, wholly without value and entirely deprived of meaning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"213#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As God ascends into His rightful place and you to yours, you will experience again the meaning of relationship and know it to be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us ascend in peace together to the Father, by giving Him ascendance in our minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will gain everything by giving Him the power and the glory, and keeping no illusions of where they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are in us, through His ascendance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What He has given is His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It shines in every part of Him, as in the whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The whole reality of your relationship with Him lies in our relationship to one another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The holy instant shines alike on all relationships, for in it they <i>are</i> one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For here is only healing, already complete and perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"213#16:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For here is God, and where He is only the perfect and complete can be.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"God established His
