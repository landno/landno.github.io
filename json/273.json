<span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not remain in conflict, for there <i>is</i> no war without attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The fear of God is fear of life, and not of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet He remains the only place of safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In Him is no attack, and no illusion in any form stalks Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Heaven is wholly true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No difference enters, and what is all the same cannot conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are not asked to fight against your wish to murder.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But you are asked to realize the form it takes conceals the same intent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And it is this you fear, and not the form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What is not love is murder.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>What is not loving must be an attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Every illusion is an assault on truth, and every one does violence to the idea of love because it seems to be of equal truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"273#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What can be equal to the truth, yet different?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Murder and love are incompatible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet if they both are true, then must they be the same, and indistinguishable from one another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>So will they be to those who see God’s Son a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it is not the body that is like the Son’s Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what is lifeless cannot be the Son of Life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How can a body be extended to hold the universe?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can it create, and be what it creates?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And can it offer its creations all that it is and never suffer loss?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"273#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God does not share His function with a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He gave the function to create unto His Son because it is His Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not sinful to believe the function of the Son is murder, but it <i>is</i> insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is the same can have no different function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Creation is the means for God’s extension, and what is His must be His Son’s as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Either the Father and the Son are murderers, or neither is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Life makes not death, creating like itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"273#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The lovely light of your relationship is like the Love of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It cannot yet assume the holy function God gave His Son, for your forgiveness of your brother is not complete as yet, and so it cannot be extended to all creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each form of murder and attack that still attracts you and that you do not recognize for what it is, limits the healing and the miracles you have the power to extend to all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet does the Holy Spirit understand how to increase your little gifts and make them mighty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Also He understands how your relationship is raised above the battleground, in it no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is your part; to realize that murder in any form is not your will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The overlooking of the battleground is now your purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"273#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be lifted up, and from a higher place look down upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From there will your perspective be quite different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here in the midst of it, it does seem real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here you have chosen to be part of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here murder is your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet from above, the choice is miracles instead of murder.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And the perspective coming from this choice shows you the battle is not real, and easily escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Bodies may battle, but the clash of forms is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And it is over when you realize it never was begun.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>How can a battle be perceived as nothingness when you engage in it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>How can the truth of miracles be recognized if murder is your choice?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"273#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When the temptation to attack rises to make your mind darkened and murderous, remember you <i>can</i> see the battle from above.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Even in forms you do not recognize, the signs you know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is a stab of pain, a twinge of guilt, and above all, a loss of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This you know well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When they occur leave not your place on high, but quickly choose a miracle instead of murder.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And God Himself and all the lights of Heaven will gently lean to you, and hold you up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For you have chosen to remain where He would have you, and no illusion can attack the peace of God together with His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"273#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>See no one from the battleground, for there you look on him from nowhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have no reference point from where to look, where meaning can be given what you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For only bodies could attack and murder, and if this is your purpose, then you must be one with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only a purpose unifies, and those who share a purpose have a mind as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The body has no purpose of itself, and must be solitary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>From below, it cannot be surmounted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>From above, the limits it exerts on those in battle still are gone, and not perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The body stands between the Father and the Heaven He created for His Son <i>because</i> it has no purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"273#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think what is given those who share their Father’s purpose, and who know that it is theirs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They want for nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Sorrow of any kind is inconceivable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only the light they love is in awareness, and only love shines upon them forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is their past, their present and their future; always the same, eternally complete and wholly shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They know it is impossible their happiness could ever suffer change of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Perhaps you think the battleground can offer something you can win.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can it be anything that offers you a perfect calmness, and a sense of love so deep and quiet that no touch of doubt can ever mar your certainty?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And that will last forever?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"273#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those with the strength of God in their awareness could never think of battle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What could they gain but loss of their perfection?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For everything fought for on the battleground is of the body; something it seems to offer or to own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one who knows that he has everything could seek for limitation, nor could he value the body’s offerings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The senselessness of conquest is quite apparent from the quiet sphere above the battleground.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What can conflict with everything?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And what is there that offers less, yet could be wanted more?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"273#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Who with the Love of God upholding him could find the choice of miracles or murder hard to make?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Do not remain in conflict, for there is no war without attack.
