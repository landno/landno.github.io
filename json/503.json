class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation and forgiveness are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They both imply that something has gone wrong; something to be saved from, forgiven for; something amiss that needs corrective change; something apart or different from the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus do both terms imply a thing impossible but yet which has occurred, resulting in a state of conflict seen between what is and what could never be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth and illusions both are equal now, for both have happened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The impossible becomes the thing you need forgiveness for, salvation from.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Salvation now becomes the borderland between the truth and the illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It reflects the truth because it is the means by which you can escape illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it is not yet the truth because it undoes what was never done.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How could there be a meeting place at all where earth and Heaven can be reconciled within a mind where both of them exist?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The mind that sees illusions thinks them real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They have existence in that they are thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet they are not real, because the mind that thinks these thoughts is separate from God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What joins the separated mind and thoughts with Mind and Thought which are forever one?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What plan could hold the truth inviolate, yet recognize the need illusions bring, and offer means by which they are undone without attack and with no touch of pain?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What but a Thought of God could be this plan, by which the never done is overlooked, and sins forgotten which were never real?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit holds this plan of God exactly as it was received of Him within the Mind of God and in your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is apart from time in that its Source is timeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it operates in time, because of your belief that time is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Unshaken does the Holy Spirit look on what you see; on sin and pain and death, on grief and separation and on loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet does He know one thing must still be true; God is still Love, and this is not His Will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the Thought that brings illusions to the truth, and sees them as appearances behind which is the changeless and the sure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the Thought that saves and that forgives, because it lays no faith in what is not created by the only Source it knows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the Thought whose function is to save by giving you its function as your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation is your function, with the One to Whom the plan was given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now are you entrusted with this plan, along with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He has one answer to appearances; regardless of their form, their size, their depth or any attribute they seem to have:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"503#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Salvation is my only function here.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God still is Love, and this is not His Will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who will yet work miracles, be sure you practice well the idea for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try to perceive the strength in what you say, for these are words in which your freedom lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your Father loves you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All the world of pain is not His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forgive yourself the thought He wanted this for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then let the Thought with which He has replaced all your mistakes enter the darkened places of your mind that thought the thoughts that never were His Will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This part belongs to God, as does the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not think its solitary thoughts, and make them real by hiding them from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let in the light, and you will look upon no obstacle to what He wills for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Open your secrets to His kindly light, and see how bright this light still shines in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Practice His Thought today, and let His light seek out and lighten up all darkened spots, and shine through them to join them to the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is God’s Will your mind be one with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is God’s Will that He has but one Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is God’s Will that His one Son is you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Think of these things in practicing today, and start the lesson that we learn today with this instruction in the way of truth:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"503#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Salvation is my only function here.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Salvation and forgiveness are the same.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"503#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Then turn to Him Who shares your function here, and let Him teach you what you need to learn to lay all fear aside, and know your Self as Love which has no opposite in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgive all thoughts which would oppose the truth of your completion, unity and peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot lose the gifts your Father gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not want to be another self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have no function that is not of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forgive yourself the one you think you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Forgiveness and salvation are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Forgive what you have made and you are saved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a special message for today which has the power to remove all forms of doubt and fear forever from your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you are tempted to believe them true, remember that appearances can not withstand the truth these mighty words contain:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"503#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Salvation is my only function here.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God still is Love, and this is not His Will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"503#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your only function tells you you are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Remind yourself of this between the times you give five minutes to be shared with Him Who shares God’s plan with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"503#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remind yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"503#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation is my only function here.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"503#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus do you lay forgiveness on your mind and let all fear be gently laid aside, that love may find its rightful place in you and show you that you are the Son of God.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Salvation and forgiveness are the same.
