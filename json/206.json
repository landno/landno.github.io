Completion","inlineNumber":"V."},"annotation":"T-16.V","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-16-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In looking at the special relationship, it is necessary first to realize that it involves a great amount of pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Anxiety, despair, guilt and attack all enter into it, broken into by periods in which they seem to be gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All these must be understood for what they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whatever form they take, they are always an attack on the self to make the other guilty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I have spoken of this before, but there are some aspects of what is really being attempted that have not been touched upon.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Very simply, the attempt to make guilty is always directed against God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the ego would have you see Him, and Him alone, as guilty, leaving the Sonship open to attack and unprotected from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The special love relationship is the ego’s chief weapon for keeping you from Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not appear to be a weapon, but if you consider how you value it and why, you will realize what it must be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The special love relationship is the ego’s most boasted gift, and one which has the most appeal to those unwilling to relinquish guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The “dynamics” of the ego are clearest here, for counting on the attraction of this offering, the fantasies that center around it are often quite overt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here they are usually judged to be acceptable and even natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one considers it bizarre to love and hate together, and even those who believe that hate is sin merely feel guilty, but do not correct it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the “natural” condition of the separation, and those who learn that it is not natural at all seem to be the unnatural ones.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For this world <i>is</i> the opposite of Heaven, being made to be its opposite, and everything here takes a direction exactly opposite of what is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In Heaven, where the meaning of love is known, love is the same as union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Here, where the illusion of love is accepted in love’s place, love is perceived as separation and exclusion.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is in the special relationship, born of the hidden wish for special love from God, that the ego’s hatred triumphs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the special relationship is the renunciation of the Love of God, and the attempt to secure for the self the specialness that He denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is essential to the preservation of the ego that you believe this specialness is not hell, but Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the ego would never have you see that separation could only be loss, being the one condition in which Heaven could not be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To everyone Heaven is completion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There can be no disagreement on this, because both the ego and the Holy Spirit accept it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are, however, in complete disagreement on what completion is, and how it is accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit knows that completion lies first in union, and then in the extension of union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To the ego completion lies in triumph, and in the extension of the “victory” even to the final triumph over God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In this it sees the ultimate freedom of the self, for nothing would remain to interfere with the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is its idea of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And therefore union, which is a condition in which the ego cannot interfere, must be hell.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The special relationship is a strange and unnatural ego device for joining hell and Heaven, and making them indistinguishable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And the attempt to find the imagined “best” of both worlds has merely led to fantasies of both, and to the inability to perceive either as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The special relationship is the triumph of this confusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a kind of union from which union is excluded, and the basis for the attempt at union rests on exclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What better example could there be of the ego’s maxim, “Seek but do not find”?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Most curious of all is the concept of the self which the ego fosters in the special relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This “self” seeks the relationship to make itself complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet when it finds the special relationship in which it thinks it can accomplish this it gives itself away, and tries to “trade” itself for the self of another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is not union, for there is no increase and no extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each partner tries to sacrifice the self he does not want for one he thinks he would prefer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And he feels guilty for the “sin” of taking, and of giving nothing of value in return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How much value can he place upon a self that he would give away to get a “better” one?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The “better” self the ego seeks is always one that is more special.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And whoever seems to possess a special self is “loved” for what can be taken from him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Where both partners see this special self in each other, the ego sees “a union made in Heaven.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For neither one will recognize that he has asked for hell, and so he will not interfere with the ego’s illusion of Heaven, which it offered him to interfere with Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet if all illusions are of fear, and they can be of nothing else, the illusion of Heaven is nothing more than an “attractive” form of fear, in which the guilt is buried deep and rises in the form of “love.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The appeal of hell lies only in the terrible attraction of guilt, which the ego holds out to those who place their faith in littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The conviction of littleness lies in every special relationship, for only the deprived could value specialness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The demand for specialness, and the perception of the giving of specialness as an act of love, would make love hateful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The real purpose of the special relationship, in strict accordance with the ego’s goals, is to destroy reality and substitute illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the ego is itself an illusion, and only illusions can be the witnesses to its “reality.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you perceived the special relationship as a triumph over God, would you want it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us not think of its fearful nature, nor of the guilt it must entail, nor of the sadness and the loneliness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For these are only attributes of the whole religion of separation, and of the total context in which it is thought to occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The central theme in its litany to sacrifice is that God must die so you can live.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is this theme that is acted out in the special relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Through the death of your self you think you can attack another self, and snatch it from the other to replace the self that you despise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you despise it because you do not think it offers the specialness that you demand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And hating it you have made it little and unworthy, because you are afraid of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can you grant unlimited power to what you think you have attacked?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So fearful has the truth become to you that unless it is weak and little, and unworthy of value, you would not dare to look upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You think it safer to endow the little self you made with power you wrested from truth, triumphing over it and leaving it helpless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>See how exactly is this ritual enacted in the special relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>An altar is erected in between two separate people, on which each seeks to kill his self, and on his body raise another self to take its power from his death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Over and over and over this ritual is enacted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it is never completed, nor ever will be completed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ritual of completion cannot complete, for life arises not from death, nor Heaven from hell.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever any form of special relationship tempts you to seek for love in ritual, remember love is content, and not form of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The special relationship is a ritual of form, aimed at raising the form to take the place of God at the expense of content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no meaning in the form, and there will never be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The special relationship must be recognized for what it is; a senseless ritual in which strength is extracted from the death of God, and invested in His killer as the sign that form has triumphed over content, and love has lost its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would you want this to be possible, even apart from its evident impossibility?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it were possible, you would have made yourself helpless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God is not angry.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He merely could not let this happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You cannot change His Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>No rituals that you have set up in which the dance of death delights you can bring death to the eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#12:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Nor can your chosen substitute for the Wholeness of God have any influence at all upon it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>See in the special relationship nothing more than a meaningless attempt to raise other gods before Him, and by worshipping them to obscure their tininess and His greatness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the name of your completion you do not want this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For every idol that you raise to place before Him stands before <i>you,</i> in place of what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation lies in the simple fact that illusions are not fearful because they are not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They but seem to be fearful to the extent to which you fail to recognize them for what they are; and you will fail to do this to the extent to which you <i>want</i> them to be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And to the same extent you are denying truth, and so are failing to make the simple choice between truth and illusion; God and fantasy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Remember this, and you will have no difficulty in perceiving the decision as just what it is, and nothing more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The core of the separation illusion lies simply in the fantasy of destruction of love’s meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And unless love’s meaning is restored to you, you cannot know yourself who share its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Separation is only the decision <i>not</i> to know yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This whole thought system is a carefully contrived learning experience, designed to lead away from truth and into fantasy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet for every learning that would hurt you, God offers you correction and complete escape from all its consequences.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The decision whether or not to listen to this course and follow it is but the choice between truth and illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For here is truth, separated from illusion and not confused with it at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How simple does this choice become when it is perceived as only what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For only fantasies make confusion in choosing possible, and they are totally unreal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"206#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This year is thus the time to make the easiest decision that ever confronted you, and also the only one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will cross the bridge into reality simply because you will recognize that God is on the other side, and nothing at all is here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"206#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is impossible not to make the natural decision as this is realized.</span></p></div>
