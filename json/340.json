<span data-sentence-id=\"340#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would God have left the meaning of the world to your interpretation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If He had, it <i>has</i> no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it cannot be that meaning changes constantly, and yet is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit looks upon the world as with one purpose, changelessly established.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And no situation can affect its aim, but must be in accord with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For only if its aim could change with every situation could each one be open to interpretation which is different every time you think of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You add an element into the script you write for every minute in the day, and all that happens now means something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You take away another element, and every meaning shifts accordingly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"340#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What do your scripts reflect except your plans for what the day <i>should</i> be?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And thus you judge disaster and success, advance, retreat, and gain and loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These judgments all are made according to the roles the script assigns.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The fact they have no meaning in themselves is demonstrated by the ease with which these labels change with other judgments, made on different aspects of experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And then, in looking back, you think you see another meaning in what went before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What have you really done, except to show there was no meaning there?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But you assigned a meaning in the light of goals that change, with every meaning shifting as they change.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"340#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only a constant purpose can endow events with stable meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But it must accord <i>one</i> meaning to them all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If they are given different meanings, it must be that they reflect but different purposes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And this is all the meaning that they have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can this be meaning?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can confusion be what meaning means?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Perception cannot be in constant flux, and make allowance for stability of meaning anywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Fear is a judgment never justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Its presence has no meaning but to show you wrote a fearful script, and are afraid accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But not because the thing you fear has fearful meaning in itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"340#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A common purpose is the only means whereby perception can be stabilized, and one interpretation given to the world and all experiences here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this shared purpose is one judgment shared by everyone and everything you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not have to judge, for you have learned one meaning has been given everything, and you are glad to see it everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It cannot change <i>because</i> you would perceive it everywhere, unchanged by circumstance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so you offer it to all events, and let them offer you stability.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"340#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Escape from judgment simply lies in this; all things have but one purpose, which you share with all the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And nothing in the world can be opposed to it, for it belongs to everything, as it belongs to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In single purpose is the end of all ideas of sacrifice, which must assume a different purpose for the one who gains and him who loses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There could be no thought of sacrifice apart from this idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is this idea of different goals that makes perception shift and meaning change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In one united goal does this become impossible, for your agreement makes interpretation stabilize and last.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"340#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can communication really be established while the symbols that are used mean different things?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit’s goal gives one interpretation, meaningful to you and to your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus can you communicate with him, and he with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In symbols that you both can understand the sacrifice of meaning is undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All sacrifice entails the loss of your ability to see relationships among events.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And looked at separately they have no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For there is no light by which they can be seen and understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They have no purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And what they are for cannot be seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>In any thought of loss there is no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>No one has agreed with you on what it means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>It is a part of a distorted script, which cannot be interpreted with meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>It must be forever unintelligible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>This is not communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>Your dark dreams are but the senseless, isolated scripts you write in sleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:16\"><span class=\"snr\">16</span>Look not to separate dreams for meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:17\"><span class=\"snr\">17</span>Only dreams of pardon can be shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#6:18\"><span class=\"snr\">18</span>They mean the same to both of you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"340#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not interpret out of solitude, for what you see means nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It will shift in what it stands for, and you will believe the world is an uncertain place, in which you walk in danger and uncertainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is but your interpretations which are lacking in stability, for they are not in line with what you really are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is a state so seemingly unsafe that fear must rise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not continue thus, my brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We have one Interpreter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And through His use of symbols are we joined, so that they mean the same to all of us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"340#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Our common language lets us speak to all our brothers, and to understand with them forgiveness has been given to us all, and thus we can communicate again.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Would God have left the meaning of the world to your
