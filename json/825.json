or better, he has an illusion of giving up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has actually merely become more honest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Recognizing that judgment was always impossible for him, he no longer attempts it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is no sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>On the contrary, he puts himself in a position where judgment <i>through</i> him rather than <i>by</i> him can occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And this judgment is neither “good” nor “bad.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is the only judgment there is, and it is only one: “God’s Son is guiltless, and sin does not exist.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"825#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The aim of our curriculum, unlike the goal of the world’s learning, is the recognition that judgment in the usual sense is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not an opinion but a fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In order to judge anything rightly, one would have to be fully aware of an inconceivably wide range of things; past, present and to come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>One would have to recognize in advance all the effects of his judgments on everyone and everything involved in them in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And one would have to be certain there is no distortion in his perception, so that his judgment would be wholly fair to everyone on whom it rests now and in the future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Who is in a position to do this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who except in grandiose fantasies would claim this for himself?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"825#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember how many times you thought you knew all the “facts” you needed for judgment, and how wrong you were!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is there anyone who has not had this experience?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you know how many times you merely thought you were right, without ever realizing you were wrong?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Why would you choose such an arbitrary basis for decision making?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"825#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Wisdom is not judgment;
