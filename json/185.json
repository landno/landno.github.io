data-sentence-id=\"185#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the darkness you have obscured the glory God gave you, and the power He bestowed upon His guiltless Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All this lies hidden in every darkened place, shrouded in guilt and in the dark denial of innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Behind the dark doors you have closed lies nothing, because nothing can obscure the gift of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the closing of the doors that interferes with recognition of the power of God that shines in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Banish not power from your mind, but let all that would hide your glory be brought to the judgment of the Holy Spirit, and there undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Whom He would save for glory <i>is</i> saved for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He has promised the Father that through Him you would be released from littleness to glory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To what He promised God He is wholly faithful, for He shares with God the promise that was given Him to share with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"185#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He shares it still, for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Everything that promises otherwise, great or small, however much or little valued, He will replace with the one promise given unto Him to lay upon the altar to your Father and His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No altar stands to God without His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And nothing brought there that is not equally worthy of Both, but will be replaced by gifts wholly acceptable to Father and to Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can you offer guilt to God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot, then, offer it to His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For They are not apart, and gifts to One are offered to the Other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You know not God because you know not this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And yet you do know God and also this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>All this is safe within you, where the Holy Spirit shines.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>He shines not in division, but in the meeting place where God, united with His Son, speaks to His Son through Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Communication between what cannot be divided cannot cease.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>The holy meeting place of the unseparated Father and His Son lies in the Holy Spirit and in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>All interference in the communication that God Himself wills with His Son is quite impossible here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>Unbroken and uninterrupted love flows constantly between the Father and the Son, as Both would have it be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#2:16\"><span class=\"snr\">16</span>And so it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"185#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let your mind wander not through darkened corridors, away from light’s center.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You and your brother may choose to lead yourselves astray, but you can be brought together only by the Guide appointed for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He will surely lead you to where God and His Son await your recognition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are joined in giving you the gift of oneness, before which all separation vanishes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Unite with what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot join with anything except reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God’s glory and His Son’s belong to you in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They have no opposite, and nothing else can you bestow upon yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"185#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no substitute for truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And truth will make this plain to you as you are brought into the place where you must meet with truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And there you must be led, through gentle understanding which can lead you nowhere else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where God is, there are you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Such is the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing can change the knowledge, given you by God, into unknowingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Everything God created knows its Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For this is how creation is accomplished by the Creator and by His creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>In the holy meeting place are joined the Father and His creations, and the creations of His Son with Them together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>There is one link that joins Them all together, holding Them in the oneness out of which creation happens.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"185#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The link with which the Father joins Himself to those He gives the power to create can never be dissolved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Heaven itself is union with all of creation, and with its one Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And Heaven remains the Will of God for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Lay no gifts other than this upon your altars, for nothing can coexist with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here your little offerings are brought together with the gift of God, and only what is worthy of the Father will be accepted by the Son, for whom it is intended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To whom God gives Himself, He <i>is</i> given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"185#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your little gifts will vanish on the altar, where He has placed His Own.</span></p></div>
