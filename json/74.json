class=\"acim-text chap-3-sect-4\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"074#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The abilities you now possess are only shadows of your real strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All of your present functions are divided and open to question and doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is because you are not certain how you will use them, and are therefore incapable of knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are also incapable of knowledge because you can still perceive lovelessly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perception did not exist until the separation introduced degrees, aspects and intervals.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Spirit has no levels, and all conflict arises from the concept of levels.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only the Levels of the Trinity are capable of unity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The levels created by the separation cannot but conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is because they are meaningless to each other.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"074#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Consciousness, the level of perception, was the first split introduced into the mind after the separation, making the mind a perceiver rather than a creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Consciousness is correctly identified as the domain of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego is a wrong-minded attempt to perceive yourself as you wish to be, rather than as you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you can know yourself only as you are, because that is all you can be sure of.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everything else <i>is</i> open to question.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"074#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is the questioning aspect of the post-separation self, which was made rather than created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is capable of asking questions but not of perceiving meaningful answers, because these would involve knowledge and cannot be perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The mind is therefore confused, because only One-mindedness can be without confusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A separated or divided mind <i>must</i> be confused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is necessarily uncertain about what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It has to be in conflict because it is out of accord with itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This makes its aspects strangers to each other, and this is the essence of the fear-prone condition, in which attack is always possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You have every reason to feel afraid as you perceive yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is why you cannot escape from fear until you realize that you did not and could not create yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You can never make your misperceptions true, and your creation is beyond your own error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>That is why you must eventually choose to heal the separation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"074#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Right-mindedness is not to be confused with the knowing mind, because it is applicable only to right perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can be right-minded or wrong-minded, and even this is subject to degrees, clearly demonstrating that knowledge is not involved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The term “right-mindedness” is properly used as the correction for “wrong-mindedness,” and applies to the state of mind that induces accurate perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is miracle-minded because it heals misperception, and this is indeed a miracle in view of how you perceive yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"074#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perception always involves some misuse of mind, because it brings the mind into areas of uncertainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The mind is very active.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When it chooses to be separated it chooses to perceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Until then it wills only to know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Afterwards it can only choose ambiguously, and the only way out of ambiguity is clear perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The mind returns to its proper function only when it wills to know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This places it in the service of spirit, where perception is changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The mind chooses to divide itself when it chooses to make its own levels.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But it could not entirely separate itself from spirit, because it is from spirit that it derives its whole power to make or create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Even in miscreation the mind is affirming its Source, or it would merely cease to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This is impossible, because the mind belongs to spirit which God created and which is therefore eternal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"074#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ability to perceive made the body possible, because you must perceive <i>something</i> and <i>with</i> something.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is why perception involves an exchange or translation, which knowledge does not need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The interpretative function of perception, a distorted form of creation, then permits you to interpret the body as yourself in an attempt to escape from the conflict you have induced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Spirit, which knows, could not be reconciled with this loss of power, because it is incapable of darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This makes spirit almost inaccessible to the mind and entirely inaccessible to the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thereafter, spirit is perceived as a threat, because light abolishes darkness merely by showing you it is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Truth will always overcome error in this way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This cannot be an active process of correction because, as I have already emphasized, knowledge does not do anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It can be perceived as an attacker, but it cannot attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What you perceive as its attack is your own vague recognition that knowledge can always be remembered, never having been destroyed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"074#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God and His creations remain in surety, and therefore know that no miscreation exists.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Truth cannot deal with errors that you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I was a man who remembered spirit and its knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As a man I did not attempt to counteract error with knowledge, but to correct error from the bottom up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I demonstrated both the powerlessness of the body and the power of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>By uniting my will with that of my Creator, I naturally remembered spirit and its real purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I cannot unite your will with God’s for you, but I can erase all misperceptions from your mind if you will bring it under my guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Only your misperceptions stand in your way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Without them your choice is certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Sane perception induces sane choosing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>I cannot choose for you, but I can help you make your own right choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>“Many are called but few are chosen” should be, “All are called but few choose to listen.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Therefore, they do not choose right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>The “chosen ones” are merely those who choose right sooner.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>Right minds can do this now, and they will find rest unto their souls.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"074#7:16\"><span class=\"snr\">16</span>God knows you only in peace, and this <i>is</i> your reality.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The abilities you now possess are only
