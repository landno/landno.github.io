data-sentence-id=\"092#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What fear has hidden still is part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Joining the Atonement is the way out of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit will help you reinterpret everything that you perceive as fearful, and teach you that only what is loving is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Truth is beyond your ability to destroy, but entirely within your ability to accept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It belongs to you because, as an extension of God, you created it with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is yours because it is part of you, just as you are part of God because He created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing that is good can be lost because it comes from the Holy Spirit, the Voice for creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nothing that is not good was ever created, and therefore cannot be protected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The Atonement is the guarantee of the safety of the Kingdom, and the union of the Sonship is its protection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The ego cannot prevail against the Kingdom because the Sonship is united.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>In the presence of those who hear the Holy Spirit’s Call to be as one, the ego fades away and is undone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"092#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What the ego makes it keeps to itself, and so it is without strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its existence is unshared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It does not die; it was merely never born.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Physical birth is not a beginning; it is a continuing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everything that continues has already been born.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It will increase as you are willing to return the unhealed part of your mind to the higher part, returning it undivided to creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I have come to give you the foundation, so your own thoughts can make you really free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You have carried the burden of unshared ideas that are too weak to increase, but having made them you did not realize how to undo them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You cannot cancel out your past errors alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>They will not disappear from your mind without the Atonement, a remedy not of your making.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The Atonement must be understood as a pure act of sharing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>That is what I meant when I said it is possible even in this world to listen to one Voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#2:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>If you are part of God and the Sonship is one, you cannot be limited to the self the ego sees.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"092#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every loving thought held in any part of the Sonship belongs to every part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is shared <i>because</i> it is loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Sharing is God’s way of creating, and also yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego can keep you in exile from the Kingdom, but in the Kingdom itself it has no power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Ideas of the spirit do not leave the mind that thinks them, nor can they conflict with each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>However, ideas of the ego can conflict because they occur at different levels and also include opposite thoughts at the same level.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span><i>It is impossible to share opposing thoughts.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You can share only the thoughts that are of God and that He keeps for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The rest remains with you until the Holy Spirit has reinterpreted them in the light of the Kingdom, making them, too, worthy of being shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>When they have been sufficiently purified He lets you give them away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The decision to share them <i>is</i> their purification.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"092#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I heard one Voice because I understood that I could not atone for myself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Listening to one Voice implies the decision to share It in order to hear It yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Mind that was in me is still irresistibly drawn to every mind created by God, because God’s Wholeness is the Wholeness of His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot be hurt, and do not want to show your brother anything except your wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Show him that he cannot hurt you and hold nothing against him, or you hold it against yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the meaning of “turning the other cheek.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"092#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Teaching is done in many ways, above all by example.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Teaching should be healing, because it is the sharing of ideas and the recognition that to share ideas is to strengthen them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I cannot forget my need to teach what I have learned, which arose in me <i>because</i> I learned it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I call upon you to teach what you have learned, because by so doing you can depend on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Make it dependable in my name because my name is the Name of God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What I learned I give you freely, and the Mind that was in me rejoices as you choose to hear it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"092#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit atones in all of us by undoing, and thus lifts the burden you have placed in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>By following Him you are led back to God where you belong, and how can you find the way except by taking your brother with you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>My part in the Atonement is not complete until you join it and give it away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As you teach so shall you learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I will never leave you or forsake you, because to forsake you would be to forsake myself and God Who created me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You forsake yourself and God if you forsake any of your brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You must learn to see them as they are, and understand they belong to God as you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How could you treat your brother better than by rendering unto God the things that are God’s?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"092#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Atonement gives you the power of a healed mind, but the power to create is of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore, those who have been forgiven must devote themselves first to healing because, having received the idea of healing, they must give it to hold it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The full power of creation cannot be expressed as long as any of God’s ideas is withheld from the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The joint will of the Sonship is the only creator that can create like the Father, because only the complete can think completely, and the thinking of God lacks nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everything you think that is not through the Holy Spirit <i>is</i> lacking.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"092#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can you who are so holy suffer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All your past except its beauty is gone, and nothing is left but a blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have saved all your kindnesses and every loving thought you ever had.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I have purified them of the errors that hid their light, and kept them for you in their own perfect radiance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are beyond destruction and beyond guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They came from the Holy Spirit within you, and we know what God creates is eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You can indeed depart in peace because I have loved you as I loved myself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You go with my blessing and for my blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Hold it and share it, that it may always be ours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I place the peace of God in your heart and in your hands, to hold and share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The heart is pure to hold it, and the hands are strong to give it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>We cannot lose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>My judgment is as strong as the wisdom of God, in Whose Heart and Hands we have our being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>His quiet children are His blessed Sons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"092#8:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>The Thoughts of God are with you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"What fear has hidden still is part of you.
