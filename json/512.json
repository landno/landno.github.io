data-sentence-id=\"512#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Vision depends upon today‚Äôs idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The light is in it, for it reconciles all seeming opposites.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what is light except the resolution, born of peace, of all your conflicts and mistaken thoughts into one concept which is wholly true?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Even that one will disappear, because the Thought behind it will appear instead to take its place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And now you are at peace forever, for the dream is over then.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"512#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>True light that makes true vision possible is not the light the body‚Äôs eyes behold.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a state of mind that has become so unified that darkness cannot be perceived at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus what is the same is seen as one, while what is not the same remains unnoticed, for it is not there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"512#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the light that shows no opposites, and vision, being healed, has power to heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the light that brings your peace of mind to other minds, to share it and be glad that they are one with you and with themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the light that heals because it brings single perception, based upon one frame of reference, from which one meaning comes.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"512#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here are both giving and receiving seen as different aspects of one Thought whose truth does not depend on which is seen as first, nor which appears to be in second place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here it is understood that both occur together, that the Thought remain complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And in this understanding is the base on which all opposites are reconciled, because they are perceived from the same frame of reference which unifies this Thought.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"512#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>One thought, completely unified, will serve to unify all thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the same as saying one correction will suffice for all correction, or that to forgive one brother wholly is enough to bring salvation to all minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For these are but some special cases of one law which holds for every kind of learning, if it be directed by the One Who knows the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"512#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To learn that giving and receiving are the same has special usefulness, because it can be tried so easily and seen as true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And when this special case has proved it always works, in every circumstance where it is tried, the thought behind it can be generalized to other areas of doubt and double vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And from there it will extend, and finally arrive at the one Thought which underlies them all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"512#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we practice with the special case of giving and receiving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will use this simple lesson in the obvious because it has results we cannot miss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To give is to receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Today we will attempt to offer peace to everyone, and see how quickly peace returns to us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Light is tranquility, and in that peace is vision given us, and we can see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"512#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>So we begin the practice periods with the instruction for today, and say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"512#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To give and to receive are one in truth.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I will receive what I am giving now.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"512#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then close your eyes, and for five minutes think of what you would hold out to everyone, to have it yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You might, for instance, say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"512#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To everyone I offer quietness.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To everyone I offer peace of mind.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To everyone I offer gentleness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"512#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Say each one slowly and then pause a while, expecting to receive the gift you gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it will come to you in the amount in which you gave it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will find you have exact return, for that is what you asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It might be helpful, too, to think of one to whom to give your gifts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He represents the others, and through him you give to all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"512#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our very simple lesson for today will teach you much.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Effect and cause will be far better understood from this time on, and we will make much faster progress now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"512#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think of the exercises for today as quick advances in your learning, made still faster and more sure each time you say, ‚ÄúTo give and to receive are one in truth.‚Äù</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Vision depends upon today‚Äôs idea.
