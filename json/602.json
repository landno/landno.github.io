data-sentence-id=\"602#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today‚Äôs idea takes another step toward quick salvation, and a giant stride it is indeed!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So great the distance is that it encompasses, it sets you down just short of Heaven, with the goal in sight and obstacles behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your foot has reached the lawns that welcome you to Heaven‚Äôs gate; the quiet place of peace, where you await with certainty the final step of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How far are we progressing now from earth!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How close are we approaching to our goal!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How short the journey still to be pursued!</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"602#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Accept today‚Äôs idea, and you have passed all anxiety, all pits of hell, all blackness of depression, thoughts of sin, and devastation brought about by guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Accept today‚Äôs idea, and you have released the world from all imprisonment by loosening the heavy chains that locked the door to freedom on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are saved, and your salvation thus becomes the gift you give the world, because you have received.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"602#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In no one instant is depression felt, or pain experienced or loss perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In no one instant sorrow can be set upon a throne, and worshipped faithfully.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In no one instant can one even die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so each instant given unto God in passing, with the next one given Him already, is a time of your release from sadness, pain and even death itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"602#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God holds your future as He holds your past and present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are one to Him, and so they should be one to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet in this world, the temporal progression still seems real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so you are not asked to understand the lack of sequence really found in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are but asked to let the future go, and place it in God‚Äôs Hands.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will see by your experience that you have laid the past and present in His Hands as well, because the past will punish you no more, and future dread will now be meaningless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"602#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Release the future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the past is gone, and what is present, freed from its bequest of grief and misery, of pain and loss, becomes the instant in which time escapes the bondage of illusions where it runs its pitiless, inevitable course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then is each instant which was slave to time transformed into a holy instant, when the light that was kept hidden in God‚Äôs Son is freed to bless the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now is he free, and all his glory shines upon a world made free with him, to share his holiness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"602#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you can see the lesson for today as the deliverance it really is, you will not hesitate to give as much consistent effort as you can, to make it be a part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As it becomes a thought that rules your mind, a habit in your problem-solving repertoire, a way of quick reaction to temptation, you extend your learning to the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And as you learn to see salvation in all things, so will the world perceive that it is saved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"602#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What worry can beset the one who gives his future to the loving Hands of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What can he suffer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What can cause him pain, or bring experience of loss to him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What can he fear?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what can he regard except with love?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For he who has escaped all fear of future pain has found his way to present peace, and certainty of care the world can never threaten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He is sure that his perception may be faulty, but will never lack correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is free to choose again when he has been deceived; to change his mind when he has made mistakes.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"602#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Place, then, your future in the Hands of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For thus you call the memory of Him to come again, replacing all your thoughts of sin and evil with the truth of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think you the world could fail to gain thereby, and every living creature not respond with healed perception?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who entrusts himself to God has also placed the world within the Hands to which he has himself appealed for comfort and security.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He lays aside the sick illusions of the world along with his, and offers peace to both.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"602#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now are we saved indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For in God‚Äôs Hands we rest untroubled, sure that only good can come to us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If we forget, we will be gently reassured.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If we accept an unforgiving thought, it will be soon replaced by love‚Äôs reflection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And if we are tempted to attack, we will appeal to Him Who guards our rest to make the choice for us that leaves temptation far behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"602#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No longer is the world our enemy, for we have chosen that we be its friend.</span></p></div>
