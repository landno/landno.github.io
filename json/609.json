<span data-sentence-id=\"609#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For this review we take but one idea each day, and practice it as often as is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Besides the time you give morning and evening, which should not be less than fifteen minutes, and the hourly remembrances you make throughout the day, use the idea as often as you can between them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each of these ideas alone would be sufficient for salvation, if it were learned truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each would be enough to give release to you and to the world from every form of bondage, and invite the memory of God to come again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"609#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>With this in mind we start our practicing, in which we carefully review the thoughts the Holy Spirit has bestowed on us in our last twenty lessons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each contains the whole curriculum if understood, practiced, accepted, and applied to all the seeming happenings throughout the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>One is enough.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But from that one, there must be no exceptions made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so we need to use them all and let them blend as one, as each contributes to the whole we learn.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"609#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These practice sessions, like our last review, are centered round a central theme with which we start and end each lesson.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"609#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I am not a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am free.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For I am still as God created me.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"609#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The day begins and ends with this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And we repeat it every time the hour strikes, or we remember, in between, we have a function that transcends the world we see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Beyond this, and a repetition of the special thought we practice for the day, no form of exercise is urged, except a deep relinquishment of everything that clutters up the mind, and makes it deaf to reason, sanity and simple truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"609#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will attempt to get beyond all words and special forms of practicing for this review.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For we attempt, this time, to reach a quickened pace along a shorter path to the serenity and peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We merely close our eyes, and then forget all that we thought we knew and understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For thus is freedom given us from all we did not know and failed to understand.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"609#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is but one exception to this lack of structuring.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Permit no idle thought to go unchallenged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you notice one, deny its hold and hasten to assure your mind that this is not what it would have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then gently let the thought which you denied be given up, in sure and quick exchange for the idea we practice for the day.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"609#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you are tempted, hasten to proclaim your freedom from temptation, as you say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"609#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This thought I do not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I choose instead _____________.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"609#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And then repeat the idea for the day, and let it take the place of what you thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Beyond such special applications of each day‚Äôs idea, we will add but a few formal expressions or specific thoughts to aid in practicing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Instead, we give these times of quiet to the Teacher Who instructs in quiet, speaks of peace, and gives our thoughts whatever meaning they may have.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"609#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To Him I offer this review for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I place you in His charge, and let Him teach you what to do and say and think, each time you turn to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He will not fail to be available to you, each time you call to Him to help you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"609#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let us offer Him the whole review we now begin, and let us also not forget to Whom it has been given, as we practice day by day, advancing toward the goal He set for us; allowing Him to teach us how to go, and trusting Him completely for the way each practice period can best become a loving gift of freedom to the world.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"For this review we
