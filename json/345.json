perceived in minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are not seen as purposes, but actions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Bodies act, and minds do not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And therefore must the body be at fault for what it does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is not seen to be a passive thing, obeying your commands, and doing nothing of itself at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you are sin you <i>are</i> a body, for the mind acts not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And purpose must be in the body, not the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The body must act on its own, and motivate itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If you are sin you lock the mind within the body, and you give its purpose to its prison house, which acts instead of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>A jailer does not follow orders, but enforces orders on the prisoner.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"345#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet is the <i>body</i> prisoner, and not the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The body thinks no thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It has no power to learn, to pardon, nor enslave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It gives no orders that the mind need serve, nor sets conditions that it must obey.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It holds in prison but the willing mind that would abide in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It sickens at the bidding of the mind that would become its prisoner.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And it grows old and dies, because that mind is sick within itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Learning is all that causes change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And so the body, where no learning can occur, could never change unless the mind preferred the body change in its appearances, to suit the purpose given by the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For mind can learn, and there is all change made.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"345#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The mind that thinks it is a sin has but one purpose; that the body be the source of sin, to keep it in the prison house it chose and guards and holds itself at bay, a sleeping prisoner to the snarling dogs of hate and evil, sickness and attack; of pain and age, of grief and suffering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here are the thoughts of sacrifice preserved, for here guilt rules, and orders that the world be like itself; a place where nothing can find mercy, nor survive the ravages of fear except in murder and in death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For here are you made sin, and sin cannot abide the joyous and the free, for they are enemies which sin must kill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In death is sin preserved, and those who think that they are sin must die for what they think they are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"345#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us be glad that you will see what you believe, and that it has been given you to change what you believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The body will but follow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It can never lead you where you would not be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not guard your sleep, nor interfere with your awakening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Release your body from imprisonment, and you will see no one as prisoner to what you have escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will not want to hold in guilt your chosen enemies, nor keep in chains, to the illusion of a changing love, the ones you think are friends.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"345#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The innocent release in gratitude for their release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what they see upholds their freedom from imprisonment and death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Open your mind to change, and there will be no ancient penalty exacted from your brother or yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"345#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For God has said there <i>is</i> no sacrifice that can be asked; there <i>is</i> no sacrifice that can be made.</span></p></div>
