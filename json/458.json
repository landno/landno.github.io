data-sentence-id=\"458#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a picture of attack on everything by everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"458#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is anything but a reflection of the Love of God and the Love of His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"458#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is my own attack thoughts that give rise to this picture.</span> <span
