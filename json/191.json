in you, it is eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What holds remembrance of God cannot be bound by time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No more are you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For unless God is bound, you cannot be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>An instant offered to the Holy Spirit is offered to God on your behalf, and in that instant you will awaken gently in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In the blessed instant you will let go all your past learning, and the Holy Spirit will quickly offer you the whole lesson of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What can take time, when all the obstacles to learning it have been removed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Truth is so far beyond time that all of it happens at once.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For as it was created one, so its oneness depends not on time at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"191#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not be concerned with time, and fear not the instant of holiness that will remove all fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the instant of peace is eternal <i>because</i> it is without fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It will come, being the lesson God gives you, through the Teacher He has appointed to translate time into eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Blessed is God’s Teacher, Whose joy it is to teach God’s holy Son his holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His joy is not contained in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His teaching is for you because His joy is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Through Him you stand before God’s altar, where He gently translates hell into Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For it is only in Heaven that God would have you be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"191#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

class=\"snr\">2</span>For you are where you have forever been and will forever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All that you have, you have forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The blessed instant reaches out to encompass time, as God extends Himself to encompass you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You who have spent days, hours and even years in chaining your brothers to your ego in an attempt to support it and uphold its weakness, do not perceive the Source of strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In this holy instant you will unchain all your brothers, and refuse to support either their weakness or your own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"191#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not realize how much you have misused your brothers by seeing them as sources of ego support.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As a result, they witness to the ego in your perception, and seem to provide reasons for not letting it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet they are far stronger and much more compelling witnesses for the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And they support His strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is, therefore, your choice whether they support the ego or the Holy Spirit in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will recognize which you have chosen by <i>their</i> reactions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>A Son of God who has been released through the Holy Spirit in a brother is always recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He cannot be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If you remain uncertain, it is only because you have not given complete release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And because of this, you have not given a single instant completely to the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>For when you have, you will be sure you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>You will be sure because the witness to Him will speak so clearly of Him that you will hear and understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>You will doubt until you hear one witness whom you have wholly released through the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#4:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>And then you will doubt no more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"191#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant has not yet happened to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it will, and you will recognize it with perfect certainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No gift of God is recognized in any other way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can practice the mechanics of the holy instant, and will learn much from doing so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet its shining and glittering brilliance, which will literally blind you to this world by its own vision, you cannot supply.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And here it is, all in this instant, complete, accomplished and given wholly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"191#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Start now to practice your little part in separating out the holy instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will receive very specific instructions as you go along.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To learn to separate out this single second, and to experience it as timeless, is to begin to experience yourself as not separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fear not that you will not be given help in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s Teacher and His lesson will support your strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is only your weakness that will depart from you in this practice, for it is the practice of the power of God in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Use it but for one instant, and you will never deny it again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Who can deny the Presence of what the universe bows to, in appreciation and gladness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"191#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Before the recognition of the universe that witnesses to It, your doubts must disappear.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The Atonement is in time, but not for time.
