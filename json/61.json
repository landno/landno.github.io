class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To extend is a fundamental aspect of God which He gave to His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the creation, God extended Himself to His creations and imbued them with the same loving Will to create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have not only been fully created, but have also been created perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no emptiness in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Because of your likeness to your Creator you are creative.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No child of God can lose this ability because it is inherent in what he is, but he can use it inappropriately by projecting.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The inappropriate use of extension, or projection, occurs when you believe that some emptiness or lack exists in you, and that you can fill it with your own ideas instead of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This process involves the following steps:<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>First, you believe that what God created can be changed by your own mind.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Second, you believe that what is perfect can be rendered imperfect or lacking.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Third, you believe that you can distort the creations of God, including yourself.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Fourth, you believe that you can create yourself, and that the direction of your own creation is up to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"061#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These related distortions represent a picture of what actually occurred in the separation, or the “detour into fear.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>None of this existed before the separation, nor does it actually exist now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Everything God created is like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Extension, as undertaken by God, is similar to the inner radiance that the children of the Father inherit from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its real source is internal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is as true of the Son as of the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In this sense the creation includes both the creation of the Son by God, and the Son’s creations when his mind is healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This requires God’s endowment of the Son with free will, because all loving creation is freely given in one continuous line, in which all aspects are of the same order.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"061#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Garden of Eden, or the pre-separation condition, was a state of mind in which nothing was needed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When Adam listened to the “lies of the serpent,” all he heard was untruth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not have to continue to believe what is not true unless you choose to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All that can literally disappear in the twinkling of an eye because it is merely a misperception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is seen in dreams seems to be very real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet the Bible says that a deep sleep fell upon Adam, and nowhere is there reference to his waking up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The world has not yet experienced any comprehensive reawakening or rebirth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Such a rebirth is impossible as long as you continue to project or miscreate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It still remains within you, however, to extend as God extended His Spirit to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>In reality this is your only choice, because your free will was given you for your joy in creating the perfect.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"061#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All fear is ultimately reducible to the basic misperception that you have the ability to usurp the power of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Of course, you neither can nor have been able to do this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here is the real basis for your escape from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The escape is brought about by your acceptance of the Atonement, which enables you to realize that your errors never really occurred.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only after the deep sleep fell upon Adam could he experience nightmares.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If a light is suddenly turned on while someone is dreaming a fearful dream, he may initially interpret the light itself as part of his dream and be afraid of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>However, when he awakens, the light is correctly perceived as the release from the dream, which is then no longer accorded reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This release does not depend on illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The knowledge that illuminates not only sets you free, but also shows you clearly that you <i>are</i> free.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"061#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whatever lies you may believe are of no concern to the miracle, which can heal any of them with equal ease.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It makes no distinctions among misperceptions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its sole concern is to distinguish between truth on the one hand, and error on the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Some miracles may seem to be of greater magnitude than others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But remember the first principle in this course; there is no order of difficulty in miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In reality you are perfectly unaffected by all expressions of lack of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>These can be from yourself and others, from yourself to others, or from others to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Peace is an attribute <i>in</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You cannot find it outside.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Illness is some form of external searching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Health is inner peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"061#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>It enables you to remain unshaken by lack of love from without and capable, through your acceptance of miracles, of correcting the conditions proceeding from lack of love in others.</span></p></div>
