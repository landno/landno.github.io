data-sentence-id=\"308#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Power cannot oppose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For opposition would weaken it, and weakened power is a contradiction in ideas.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Weak strength is meaningless, and power used to weaken is employed to limit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And therefore it must be limited and weak, because that is its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Power is unopposed, to be itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No weakness can intrude on it without changing it into something it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To weaken is to limit, and impose an opposite that contradicts the concept that it attacks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And by this does it join to the idea a something it is not, and make it unintelligible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Who can understand a double concept, such as “weakened power” or “hateful love”?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"308#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have decided that your brother is a symbol for a “hateful love,” a “weakened power,” and above all, a “living death.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so he has no meaning to you, for he stands for what is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He represents a double thought, where half is cancelled out by the remaining half.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet even this is quickly contradicted by the half it cancelled out, and so they both are gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And now he stands for nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Symbols which but represent ideas that cannot be must stand for empty space and nothingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet nothingness and empty space can not be interference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What can interfere with the awareness of reality is the belief that there is something there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"308#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The picture of your brother that you see means nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is nothing to attack or to deny; to love or hate, or to endow with power or to see as weak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The picture has been wholly cancelled out, because it symbolized a contradiction that cancelled out the thought it represents.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thus the picture has no cause at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who can perceive effect without a cause?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What can the causeless be but nothingness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The picture of your brother that you see is wholly absent and has never been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Let, then, the empty space it occupies be recognized as vacant, and the time devoted to its seeing be perceived as idly spent, a time unoccupied.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"308#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>An empty space that is not seen as filled, an unused interval of time not seen as spent and fully occupied, become a silent invitation to the truth to enter, and to make itself at home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No preparation can be made that would enhance the invitation’s real appeal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what you leave as vacant God will fill, and where He is there must the truth abide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Unweakened power, with no opposite, is what creation is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For this there are no symbols.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing points beyond the truth, for what can stand for more than everything?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet true undoing must be kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so the first replacement for your picture is another picture of another kind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"308#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As nothingness cannot be pictured, so there is no symbol for totality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Reality is ultimately known without a form, unpictured and unseen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiveness is not yet a power known as wholly free of limits.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it sets no limits you have chosen to impose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forgiveness is the means by which the truth is represented temporarily.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It lets the Holy Spirit make exchange of pictures possible, until the time when aids are meaningless and learning done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No learning aid has use that can extend beyond the goal of learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>When its aim has been accomplished it is functionless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet in the learning interval it has a use that now you fear, but yet will love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"308#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The picture of your brother given you to occupy the space so lately left unoccupied and vacant will not need defense of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you will give it overwhelming preference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor delay an instant in deciding that it is the only one you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not stand for double concepts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Though it is but half the picture and is incomplete, within itself it is the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The other half of what it represents remains unknown, but is not cancelled out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And thus is God left free to take the final step Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For this you need no pictures and no learning aids.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And what will ultimately take the place of every learning aid will merely <i>be.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"308#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness vanishes and symbols fade, and nothing that the eyes have ever seen or ears have heard remains to be perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A power wholly limitless has come, not to destroy, but to receive its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no choice of function anywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The choice you fear to lose you never had.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet only this appears to interfere with power unlimited and single thoughts, complete and happy, without opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not know the peace of power that opposes nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet no other kind can be at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Give welcome to the power beyond forgiveness, and beyond the world of symbols and of limitations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"308#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He would merely be, and so He merely is.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Power cannot oppose.
