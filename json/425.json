data-sentence-id=\"425#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But there is indeed a point in changing your thoughts about the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here you are changing the cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The effect will change automatically.</span></p></div> <div

everything in it is a symbol of vengeance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each of your perceptions of ‚Äúexternal reality‚Äù is a pictorial representation of your own attack thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>One can well ask if this can be called seeing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is not fantasy a better word for such a process, and hallucination a more appropriate term for the result?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"425#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You see the world that you have made, but you do not see yourself as the image maker.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot be saved from the world, but you can escape from its cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is what salvation means, for where is the world you see when its cause is gone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Vision already holds a replacement for everything you think you see now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Loveliness can light your images, and so transform them that you will love them, even though they were made of hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For you will not be making them alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"425#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea for today introduces the thought that you are not trapped in the world you see, because its cause can be changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This change requires, first, that the cause be identified and then let go, so that it can be replaced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The first two steps in this process require your cooperation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The final one does not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your images have already been replaced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>By taking the first two steps, you will see that this is so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"425#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Besides using it throughout the day as the need arises, five practice periods are required in applying today‚Äôs idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As you look about you, repeat the idea slowly to yourself first, and then close your eyes and devote about a minute to searching your mind for as many attack thoughts as occur to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As each one crosses your mind say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"425#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I can escape from the world I see by giving up attack thoughts about _________.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"425#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Hold each attack thought in mind as you say this, and then dismiss that thought and go on to the next.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"425#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the practice periods, be sure to include both your thoughts of attacking and of being attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Their effects are exactly the same because they are exactly the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not recognize this as yet, and you are asked at this time only to treat them as the same in today‚Äôs practice periods.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We are still at the stage of identifying the cause of the world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"425#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When you finally learn that thoughts of attack and of being attacked are not different, you will be ready to let the cause go.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The idea for
