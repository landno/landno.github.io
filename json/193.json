data-sentence-id=\"193#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This course is not beyond immediate learning, unless you believe that what God wills takes time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this means only that you would rather delay the recognition that His Will is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The holy instant is this instant and every instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The one you want it to be it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The one you would not have it be is lost to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You must decide when it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Delay it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For beyond the past and future, where you will not find it, it stands in shimmering readiness for your acceptance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet you cannot bring it into glad awareness while you do not want it, for it holds the whole release from littleness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"193#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your practice must therefore rest upon your willingness to let all littleness go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The instant in which magnitude dawns upon you is but as far away as your desire for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As long as you desire it not and cherish littleness instead, by so much is it far from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By so much as you want it will you bring it nearer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Think not that you can find salvation in your own way and have it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Give over every plan you have made for your salvation in exchange for God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His will content you, and nothing else can bring you peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For peace is of God, and no one beside Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"193#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be humble before Him, and yet great <i>in</i> Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And value no plan of the ego before the plan of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For you leave empty your place in His plan, which you must fill if you would join with me, by your decision to join in any plan but His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I call you to fulfill your holy part in the plan that He has given to the world for its release from littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God would have His host abide in perfect freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Every allegiance to a plan of salvation apart from Him diminishes the value of His Will for you in your own mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And yet it is your mind that is the host to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"193#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you learn how perfect and immaculate is the holy altar on which your Father has placed Himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This you will recognize in the holy instant, in which you willingly and gladly give over every plan but His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For there lies peace, perfectly clear because you have been willing to meet its conditions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can claim the holy instant any time and anywhere you want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In your practice, try to give over every plan you have accepted for finding magnitude in littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span><i>It is not there.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Use the holy instant only to recognize that you alone cannot know where it is, and can only deceive yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"193#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I stand within the holy instant, as clear as you would have me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And the extent to which you learn to accept me is the measure of the time in which the holy instant will be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I call to you to make the holy instant yours at once, for the release from littleness in the mind of the host of God depends on willingness, and not on time.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"193#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The reason this course is simple is that truth is simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Complexity is of the ego, and is nothing more than the ego’s attempt to obscure the obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You could live forever in the holy instant, beginning now and reaching to eternity, but for a very simple reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not obscure the simplicity of this reason, for if you do, it will be only because you prefer not to recognize it and not to let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The simple reason, simply stated, is this: The holy instant is a time in which you receive and give perfect communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This means, however, that it is a time in which your mind is open, both to receive and give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is the recognition that all minds are in communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It therefore seeks to change nothing, but merely to accept everything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"193#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can you do this when you would prefer to have private thoughts and keep them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The only way you could do that would be to deny the perfect communication that makes the holy instant what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You believe you can harbor thoughts you would not share, and that salvation lies in keeping thoughts to yourself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For in private thoughts, known only to yourself, you think you find a way to keep what you would have alone, and share what <i>you</i> would share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And then you wonder why it is that you are not in full communication with those around you, and with God Who surrounds all of you together.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"193#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every thought you would keep hidden shuts communication off, because you would have it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is impossible to recognize perfect communication while breaking communication holds value to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Ask yourself honestly, “Would I want to have perfect communication, and am I wholly willing to let everything that interferes with it go forever?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If the answer is no, then the Holy Spirit’s readiness to give it to you is not enough to make it yours, for you are not ready to share it with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it cannot come into a mind that has decided to oppose it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the holy instant is given and received with equal willingness, being the acceptance of the single Will that governs all thought.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"193#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The necessary condition for the holy instant does not require that you have no thoughts that are not pure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But it does require that you have none that you would keep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Innocence is not of your making.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is given you the instant you would have it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Atonement would not be if there were no need for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will not be able to accept perfect communication as long as you would hide it from yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For what you would hide <i>is</i> hidden from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In your practice, then, try only to be vigilant against deception, and seek not to protect the thoughts you would keep to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let the Holy Spirit’s purity shine them away, and bring all your awareness to the readiness for purity He offers you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"193#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Thus will He make you ready to acknowledge that you are host to God, and hostage to no one and to nothing.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"This course is not beyond immediate learning, unless you believe that what
