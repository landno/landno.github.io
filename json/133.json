Healer","inlineNumber":"V."},"annotation":"T-9.V","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-9-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"133#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s plan for forgiveness is far more widely used than God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is because it is undertaken by unhealed healers, and is therefore of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let us consider the unhealed healer more carefully now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By definition, he is trying to give what he has not received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If an unhealed healer is a theologian, for example, he may begin with the premise, “I am a miserable sinner, and so are you.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If he is a psychotherapist, he is more likely to start with the equally incredible belief that attack is real for both himself and the patient, but that it does not matter for either of them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"133#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have repeatedly said that beliefs of the ego cannot be shared, and this is why they are unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How, then, can “uncovering” them make them real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every healer who searches fantasies for truth must be unhealed, because he does not know where to look for truth, and therefore does not have the answer to the problem of healing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"133#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is an advantage to bringing nightmares into awareness, but only to teach that they are not real, and that anything they contain is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The unhealed healer cannot do this because he does not believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All unhealed healers follow the ego’s plan for forgiveness in one form or another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If they are theologians they are likely to condemn themselves, teach condemnation and advocate a fearful solution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Projecting condemnation onto God, they make Him appear retaliative, and fear His retribution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What they have done is merely to identify with the ego, and by perceiving what <i>it</i> does, condemn themselves because of this confusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is understandable that there have been revolts against this concept, but to revolt against it is still to believe in it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"133#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Some newer forms of the ego’s plan are as unhelpful as the older ones, because form does not matter and the content has not changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In one of the newer forms, for example, a psychotherapist may interpret the ego’s symbols in a nightmare, and then use them to prove that the nightmare is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Having made it real, he then attempts to dispel its effects by depreciating the importance of the dreamer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This would be a healing approach if the dreamer were also identified as unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet if the dreamer is equated with the mind, the mind’s corrective power through the Holy Spirit is denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is a contradiction even in the ego’s terms, and one which it usually notes even in its confusion.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"133#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If the way to counteract fear is to reduce the importance of the mind, how can this build ego strength?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Such evident inconsistencies account for why no one has really explained what happens in psychotherapy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing really does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing real has happened to the unhealed healer, and he must learn from his own teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His ego will always seek to get something from the situation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The unhealed healer therefore does not know how to give, and consequently cannot share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He cannot correct because he is not working correctively.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He believes that it is up to him to teach the patient what is real, although he does not know it himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"133#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What, then, should happen?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When God said, “Let there be light,” there <i>was</i> light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Can you find light by analyzing darkness, as the psychotherapist does, or like the theologian, by acknowledging darkness in yourself and looking for a distant light to remove it, while emphasizing the distance?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Healing is not mysterious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothing will change unless it is understood, since light <i>is</i> understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A “miserable sinner” cannot be healed without magic, nor can an “unimportant mind” esteem itself without magic.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"133#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Both forms of the ego’s approach, then, must arrive at an impasse; the characteristic “impossible situation” to which the ego always leads.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It may help someone to point out where he is heading, but the point is lost unless he is also helped to change his direction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The unhealed healer cannot do this for him, since he cannot do it for himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The only meaningful contribution the healer can make is to present an example of one whose direction has been changed <i>for</i> him, and who no longer believes in nightmares of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The light in his mind will therefore answer the questioner, who must decide with God that there is light <i>because</i> he sees it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And by his acknowledgment the healer knows it is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is how perception ultimately is translated into knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The miracle worker begins by perceiving light, and translates his perception into sureness by continually extending it and accepting its acknowledgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Its effects assure him it is there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"133#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A therapist does not heal; <i>he lets healing be.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He can point to darkness but he cannot bring light of himself, for light is not of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet, being <i>for</i> him, it must also be for his patient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit is the only Therapist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He makes healing clear in any situation in which He is the Guide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can only let Him fulfill His function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He needs no help for this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He will tell you exactly what to do to help anyone He sends to you for help, and will speak to him through you if you do not interfere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Remember that you choose the guide for helping, and the wrong choice will not help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But remember also that the right one will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Trust Him, for help is His function, and He is of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>As you awaken other minds to the Holy Spirit through Him, and not yourself, you will understand that you are not obeying the laws of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>But the laws you are obeying work.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>“The good is what works” is a sound though insufficient statement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>Only the good <i>can</i> work.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"133#8:16\"><span class=\"snr\">16</span>Nothing else works at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"133#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span
