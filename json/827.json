it is a change of mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing external alters, but everything internal now reflects only the Love of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God can no longer be feared, for the mind sees no cause for punishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s teachers appear to be many, for that is what is the world’s need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet being joined in one purpose, and one they share with God, how could they be separate from each other?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What does it matter if they then appear in many forms?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Their minds are one; their joining is complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And God works through them now as one, for that is what they are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"827#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why is the illusion of many necessary?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only because reality is not understandable to the deluded.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only very few can hear God’s Voice at all, and even they cannot communicate His messages directly through the Spirit which gave them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They need a medium through which communication becomes possible to those who do not realize that they are spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A body they can see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A voice they understand and listen to, without the fear that truth would encounter in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not forget that truth can come only where it is welcomed without fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>So do God’s teachers need a body, for their unity could not be recognized directly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"827#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet what makes God’s teachers is their recognition of the proper purpose of the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As they advance in their profession, they become more and more certain that the body’s function is but to let God’s Voice speak through it to human ears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And these ears will carry to the mind of the hearer messages that are not of this world, and the mind will understand because of their Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>From this understanding will come the recognition, in this new teacher of God, of what the body’s purpose really is; the only use there really is for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This lesson is enough to let the thought of unity come in, and what is one is recognized as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The teachers of God appear to share the illusion of separation, but because of what they use the body for, they do not believe in the illusion despite appearances.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"827#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The central lesson is always this; that what you use the body for it will become to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Use it for sin or for attack, which is the same as sin, and you will see it as sinful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Because it is sinful it is weak, and being weak, it suffers and it dies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Use it to bring the Word of God to those who have it not, and the body becomes holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Because it is holy it cannot be sick, nor can it die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When its usefulness is done it is laid by, and that is all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The mind makes this decision, as it makes all decisions that are responsible for the body’s condition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet the teacher of God does not make this decision alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To do that would be to give the body another purpose from the one that keeps it holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God’s Voice will tell him when he has fulfilled his role, just as It tells him what his function is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>He does not suffer either in going or remaining.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Sickness is now impossible to him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"827#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Oneness and sickness cannot coexist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God’s teachers choose to look on dreams a while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a conscious choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For they have learned that all choices are made consciously, with full awareness of their consequences.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The dream says otherwise, but who would put his faith in dreams once they are recognized for what they are?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Awareness of dreaming is the real function of God’s teachers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They watch the dream figures come and go, shift and change, suffer and die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet they are not deceived by what they see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>They recognize that to behold a dream figure as sick and separate is no more real than to regard it as healthy and beautiful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Unity alone is not a thing of dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"827#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And it is this God’s teachers acknowledge as behind the dream, beyond all seeming and yet surely theirs.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The answer to this question is—one.
