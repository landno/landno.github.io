data-sentence-id=\"182#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The only part of your mind that has reality is the part that links you still with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you have all of it transformed into a radiant message of God’s Love, to share with all the lonely ones who have denied Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span><i>God makes this possible.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would you deny His yearning to be known?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You yearn for Him, as He for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is forever changeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Accept, then, the immutable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Leave the world of death behind, and return quietly to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There is nothing of value here, and everything of value there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Listen to the Holy Spirit, and to God through Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>He speaks of you to <i>you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>There is no guilt in you, for God is blessed in His Son as the Son is blessed in Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"182#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone has a special part to play in the Atonement, but the message given to each one is always the same; <i>God’s Son is guiltless.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each one teaches the message differently, and learns it differently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet until he teaches it and learns it, he will suffer the pain of dim awareness that his true function remains unfulfilled in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The burden of guilt is heavy, but God would not have you bound by it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His plan for your awaking is as perfect as yours is fallible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You know not what you do, but He Who knows is with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His gentleness is yours, and all the love you share with God He holds in trust for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He would teach you nothing except how to be happy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"182#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Blessed Son of a wholly blessing Father, joy was created for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who can condemn whom God has blessed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is nothing in the Mind of God that does not share His shining innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Creation is the natural extension of perfect purity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your only calling here is to devote yourself, with active willingness, to the denial of guilt in all its forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To accuse is <i>not to understand.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The happy learners of the Atonement become the teachers of the innocence that is the right of all that God created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Deny them not what is their due, for you will not withhold it from them alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"182#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The inheritance of the Kingdom is the right of God’s Son, given him in his creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not try to steal it from him, or you will ask for guilt and will experience it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Protect his purity from every thought that would steal it away and keep it from his sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Bring innocence to light, in answer to the call of the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Never allow purity to remain hidden, but shine away the heavy veils of guilt within which the Son of God has hidden himself from his own sight.</span></p></div> <div

nothing else can unite us in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So will the world of separation slip away, and full communication be restored between the Father and the Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The miracle acknowledges the guiltlessness that must have been denied to produce the need of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not withhold this glad acknowledgment, for hope of happiness and release from suffering of every kind lie in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who is there but wishes to be free of pain?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He may not yet have learned how to exchange guilt for innocence, nor realize that only in this exchange can freedom from pain be his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet those who have failed to learn need teaching, not attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To attack those who have need of teaching is to fail to learn from them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"182#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Teachers of innocence, each in his own way, have joined together, taking their part in the unified curriculum of the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no unity of learning goals apart from this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no conflict in this curriculum, which has one aim however it is taught.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each effort made on its behalf is offered for the single purpose of release from guilt, to the eternal glory of God and His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And every teaching that points to this points straight to Heaven, and the peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no pain, no trial, no fear that teaching this can fail to overcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#6:7\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"182#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one can be untouched by teaching such as this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will not see yourself beyond the power of God if you teach only this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will not be exempt from the effects of this most holy lesson, which seeks but to restore what is the right of God’s creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>From everyone whom you accord release from guilt you will inevitably learn your innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The circle of Atonement has no end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you will find ever-increasing confidence in your safe inclusion in the circle with everyone you bring within its safety and its perfect peace.</span></p></div> <div

teacher of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For peace is the acknowledgment of perfect purity, from which no one is excluded.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Within its holy circle is everyone whom God created as His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Joy is its unifying attribute, with no one left outside to suffer guilt alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The power of God draws everyone to its safe embrace of love and union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Stand quietly within this circle, and attract all tortured minds to join with you in the safety of its peace and holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Abide with me within it, as a teacher of Atonement, not of guilt.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"182#9\"><p

data-sentence-id=\"182#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Our power comes not of us, but of our Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In guiltlessness we know Him, as He knows us guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I stand within the circle, calling you to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#9:5\"><span

given him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Believe not that you cannot teach His perfect peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Stand not outside, but join with me within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Fail not the only purpose to which my teaching calls you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Restore to God His Son as He created him, by teaching him his innocence.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"182#10\"><p

data-sentence-id=\"182#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only the resurrection became my part in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is the symbol of the release from guilt by guiltlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whom you perceive as guilty you would crucify.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you restore guiltlessness to whomever you see as guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Crucifixion is always the ego’s aim.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It sees everyone as guilty, and by its condemnation it would kill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Holy Spirit sees only guiltlessness, and in His gentleness He would release from fear and re-establish the reign of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The power of love is in His gentleness, which is of God and therefore cannot crucify nor suffer crucifixion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The temple you restore becomes your altar, for it was rebuilt through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And everything you give to God is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#10:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Thus He creates, and thus must you restore.</span></p></div>

holy circle of Atonement or leave outside, judging him fit for crucifixion or for redemption.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you bring him into the circle of purity, you will rest there with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you leave him without, you join him there.</span> <span

anyone as without the blessing of Atonement, and bring him into it by blessing him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Holiness must be shared, for therein lies everything that makes it holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"182#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Come gladly to the holy circle, and look out in peace on all who think they are outside.</span>
