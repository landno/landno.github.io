data-sentence-id=\"576#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one attacks without intent to hurt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This can have no exception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you think that you attack in self-defense, you mean that to be cruel is protection; you are safe because of cruelty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You mean that you believe to hurt another brings you freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you mean that to attack is to exchange the state in which you are for something better, safer, more secure from dangerous invasion and from fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How thoroughly insane is the idea that to defend from fear is to attack!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For here is fear begot and fed with blood, to make it grow and swell and rage.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus is fear protected, not escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Today we learn a lesson which can save you more delay and needless misery than you can possibly imagine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You make what you defend against, and by your own defense against it is it real and inescapable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Lay down your arms, and only then do you perceive it false.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It seems to be the enemy without that you attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet your defense sets up an enemy within; an alien thought at war with you, depriving you of peace, splitting your mind into two camps which seem wholly irreconcilable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For love now has an “enemy,” an opposite; and fear, the alien, now needs your defense against the threat of what you really are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you consider carefully the means by which your fancied self-defense proceeds on its imagined way, you will perceive the premises on which the idea stands.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>First, it is obvious ideas must leave their source, for it is you who make attack, and must have first conceived of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you attack outside yourself, and separate your mind from him who is to be attacked, with perfect faith the split you made is real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Next, are the attributes of love bestowed upon its “enemy.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For fear becomes your safety and protector of your peace, to which you turn for solace and escape from doubts about your strength, and hope of rest in dreamless quiet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And as love is shorn of what belongs to it and it alone, love is endowed with attributes of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For love would ask you lay down all defense as merely foolish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And your arms indeed would crumble into dust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For such they are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>With love as enemy, must cruelty become a god.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And gods demand that those who worship them obey their dictates, and refuse to question them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Harsh punishment is meted out relentlessly to those who ask if the demands are sensible or even sane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is their enemies who are unreasonable and insane, while they are always merciful and just.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we look upon this cruel god dispassionately.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And we note that though his lips are smeared with blood, and fire seems to flame from him, he is but made of stone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He can do nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We need not defy his power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has none.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And those who see in him their safety have no guardian, no strength to call upon in danger, and no mighty warrior to fight for them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This moment can be terrible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But it can also be the time of your release from abject slavery.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You make a choice, standing before this idol, seeing him exactly as he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Will you restore to love what you have sought to wrest from it and lay before this mindless piece of stone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Or will you make another idol to replace it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the god of cruelty takes many forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Another can be found.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet do not think that fear is the escape from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us remember what the text has stressed about the obstacles to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The final one, the hardest to believe is nothing, and a seeming obstacle with the appearance of a solid block, impenetrable, fearful and beyond surmounting, is the fear of God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here is the basic premise which enthrones the thought of fear as god.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For fear is loved by those who worship it, and love appears to be invested now with cruelty.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Where does the totally insane belief in gods of vengeance come from?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love has not confused its attributes with those of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet must the worshippers of fear perceive their own confusion in fear’s “enemy”; its cruelty as now a part of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what becomes more fearful than the Heart of Love Itself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The blood appears to be upon His Lips; the fire comes from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And He is terrible above all else, cruel beyond conception, striking down all who acknowledge Him to be their God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The choice you make today is certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you look for the last time upon this bit of carven stone you made, and call it god no longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have reached this place before, but you have chosen that this cruel god remain with you in still another form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so the fear of God returned with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This time you leave it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you return to a new world, unburdened by its weight; beheld not in its sightless eyes, but in the vision that your choice restored to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now do your eyes belong to Christ, and He looks through them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now your voice belongs to God and echoes His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And now your heart remains at peace forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have chosen Him in place of idols, and your attributes, given by your Creator, are restored to you at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Call for God is heard and answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Now has fear made way for love, as God Himself replaces cruelty.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#13\"><p class=\"p-italic\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Father, we are like You.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No cruelty abides in us, for there is none in You.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your peace is ours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And we bless the world with what we have received from You alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We choose again, and make our choice for all our brothers, knowing they are one with us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We bring them Your salvation as we have received it now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And we give thanks for them who render us complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In them we see Your glory, and in them we find our peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Holy are we because Your Holiness has set us free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And we give thanks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#13:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Amen.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"No one attacks without intent to hurt.
