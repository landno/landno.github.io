class=\"acim-text chap-3-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have said that the abilities you possess are only shadows of your real strength, and that perception, which is inherently judgmental, was introduced only after the separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one has been sure of anything since.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have also made it clear that the resurrection was the means for the return to knowledge, which was accomplished by the union of my will with the Father’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We can now establish a distinction that will clarify some of our subsequent statements.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Since the separation, the words “create” and “make” have become confused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you make something, you do so out of a specific sense of lack or need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Anything made for a specific purpose has no true generalizability.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you make something to fill a perceived lack, you are tacitly implying that you believe in separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego has invented many ingenious thought systems for this purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>None of them is creative.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Inventiveness is wasted effort even in its most ingenious form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The highly specific nature of invention is not worthy of the abstract creativity of God’s creations.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Knowing, as we have already observed, does not lead to doing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The confusion between your real creation and what you have made of yourself is so profound that it has become literally impossible for you to know anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Knowledge is always stable, and it is quite evident that you are not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nevertheless, you are perfectly stable as God created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In this sense, when your behavior is unstable, you are disagreeing with God’s idea of your creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can do this if you choose, but you would hardly want to do it if you were in your right mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The fundamental question you continually ask yourself cannot properly be directed to yourself at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You keep asking what it is you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This implies that the answer is not only one you know, but is also one that is up to you to supply.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you cannot perceive yourself correctly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have no image to be perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The word “image” is always perception-related, and not a part of knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Images are symbolic and stand for something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The idea of “changing your image” recognizes the power of perception, but also implies that there is nothing stable to know.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Knowing is not open to interpretation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may try to “interpret” meaning, but this is always open to error because it refers to the <i>perception</i> of meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Such incongruities are the result of attempts to regard yourself as separated and unseparated at the same time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is impossible to make so fundamental a confusion without increasing your overall confusion still further.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your mind may have become very ingenious, but as always happens when method and content are separated, it is utilized in a futile attempt to escape from an inescapable impasse.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ingenuity is totally divorced from knowledge, because knowledge does not require ingenuity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Ingenious thinking is <i>not</i> the truth that shall set you free, but you are free of the need to engage in it when you are willing to let it go.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Prayer is a way of asking for something.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the medium of miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But the only meaningful prayer is for forgiveness, because those who have been forgiven have everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Once forgiveness has been accepted, prayer in the usual sense becomes utterly meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The prayer for forgiveness is nothing more than a request that you may be able to recognize what you already have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In electing perception instead of knowledge, you placed yourself in a position where you could resemble your Father only by perceiving miraculously.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have lost the knowledge that you yourself are a miracle of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Creation is your Source and your only real function.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The statement “God created man in his own image and likeness” needs reinterpretation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>“Image” can be understood as “thought,” and “likeness” as “of a like quality.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God did create spirit in His Own Thought and of a quality like to His Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There <i>is</i> nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perception, on the other hand, is impossible without a belief in “more” and “less.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>At every level it involves selectivity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Perception is a continual process of accepting and rejecting, organizing and reorganizing, shifting and changing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Evaluation is an essential part of perception, because judgments are necessary in order to select.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What happens to perceptions if there are no judgments and nothing but perfect equality?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perception becomes impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Truth can only be known.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All of it is equally true, and knowing any part of it is to know all of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only perception involves partial awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Knowledge transcends the laws governing perception, because partial knowledge is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is all one and has no separate parts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You who are really one with it need but know yourself and your knowledge is complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To know God’s miracle is to know Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness is the healing of the perception of separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Correct perception of your brother is necessary, because minds have chosen to see themselves as separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Spirit knows God completely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is its miraculous power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The fact that each one has this power completely is a condition entirely alien to the world’s thinking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The world believes that if anyone has everything, there is nothing left.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But God’s miracles are as total as His Thoughts because they <i>are</i> His Thoughts.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"075#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As long as perception lasts prayer has a place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Since perception rests on lack, those who perceive have not totally accepted the Atonement and given themselves over to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Perception is based on a separated state, so that anyone who perceives at all needs healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Communion, not prayer, is the natural state of those who know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God and His miracle are inseparable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How beautiful indeed are the Thoughts of God who live in His light!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your worth is beyond perception because it is beyond doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not perceive yourself in different lights.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"075#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Know yourself in the One Light where the miracle that is you is perfectly clear.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"I have said that the abilities you possess are only shadows of your real strength, and that perception,
