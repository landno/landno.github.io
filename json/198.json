data-sentence-id=\"198#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As the ego would limit your perception of your brothers to the body, so would the Holy Spirit release your vision and let you see the Great Rays shining from them, so unlimited that they reach to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is this shift to vision that is accomplished in the holy instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it is needful for you to learn just what this shift entails, so you will become willing to make it permanent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Given this willingness it will not leave you, for it <i>is</i> permanent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Once you have accepted it as the only perception you want, it is translated into knowledge by the part that God Himself plays in the Atonement, for it is the only step in it He understands.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Therefore, in this there will be no delay when you are ready for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God is ready now, but you are not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"198#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our task is but to continue, as fast as possible, the necessary process of looking straight at all the interference and seeing it exactly as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it is impossible to recognize as wholly without gratification what you think you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body is the symbol of the ego, as the ego is the symbol of the separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And both are nothing more than attempts to limit communication, and thereby to make it impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For communication must be unlimited in order to have meaning, and deprived of meaning, it will not satisfy you completely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it remains the only means by which you can establish real relationships, which have no limits, having been established by God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"198#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the holy instant, where the Great Rays replace the body in awareness, the recognition of relationships without limits is given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But in order to see this, it is necessary to give up every use the ego has for the body, and to accept the fact that the ego has no purpose you would share with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the ego would limit everyone to a body for its own purposes, and while you think it has a purpose, you will choose to utilize the means by which it tries to turn its purpose into accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This will never be accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you have surely recognized that the ego, whose goals are altogether unattainable, will strive for them with all its might, and will do so with the strength that you have given it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"198#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible to divide your strength between Heaven and hell, God and the ego, and release your power to creation, which is the only purpose for which it was given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love would always give increase.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Limits are demanded by the ego, and represent its demands to make little and ineffectual.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Limit your sight of a brother to his body, which you will do as long as you would not release him from it, and you have denied his gift to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His body cannot give it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And seek it not through yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet your minds are already continuous, and their union need only be accepted and the loneliness in Heaven is gone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"198#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you would but let the Holy Spirit tell you of the Love of God for you, and the need your creations have to be with you forever, you would experience the attraction of the eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one can hear Him speak of this and long remain willing to linger here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it is your will to be in Heaven, where you are complete and quiet, in such sure and loving relationships that any limit is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would you not exchange your little relationships for this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the body <i>is</i> little and limited, and only those whom you would see without the limits the ego would impose on them can offer you the gift of freedom.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"198#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have no conception of the limits you have placed on your perception, and no idea of all the loveliness that you could see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But this you must remember; the attraction of guilt opposes the attraction of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His attraction for you remains unlimited, but because your power, being His, is as great as His, you can turn away from love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you invest in guilt you withdraw from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And your sight grows weak and dim and limited, for you have attempted to separate the Father from the Son, and limit Their communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Seek not Atonement in further separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And limit not your vision of God’s Son to what interferes with his release, and what the Holy Spirit must undo to set him free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For his belief in limits <i>has</i> imprisoned him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"198#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When the body ceases to attract you, and when you place no value on it as a means of getting anything, then there will be no interference in communication and your thoughts will be as free as God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As you let the Holy Spirit teach you how to use the body only for purposes of communication, and renounce its use for separation and attack which the ego sees in it, you will learn you have no need of a body at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In the holy instant there are no bodies, and you experience only the attraction of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Accepting it as undivided you join Him wholly, in an instant, for you would place no limits on your union with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The reality of this relationship becomes the only truth that you could ever want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"198#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All truth <i>is</i> here.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"As the ego would limit your perception of your
