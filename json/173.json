Guilt","inlineNumber":"IX."},"annotation":"T-13.IX","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-13-sect-9\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"173#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Guilt remains the only thing that hides the Father, for guilt is the attack upon His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The guilty always condemn, and having done so they will still condemn, linking the future to the past as is the ego’s law.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fidelity to this law lets no light in, for it demands fidelity to darkness and forbids awakening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego’s laws are strict, and breaches are severely punished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore give no obedience to its laws, for they are laws of punishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And those who follow them believe that they are guilty, and so they must condemn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Between the future and the past the laws of God must intervene, if you would free yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Atonement stands between them, like a lamp shining so brightly that the chain of darkness in which you bound yourself will disappear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"173#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Release from guilt is the ego’s whole undoing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span><i>Make no one fearful,</i> for his guilt is yours, and by obeying the ego’s harsh commandments you bring its condemnation on yourself, and you will not escape the punishment it offers those who obey it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego rewards fidelity to it with pain, for faith in it <i>is</i> pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And faith can be rewarded only in terms of the belief in which the faith was placed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Faith makes the power of belief, and where it is invested determines its reward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For faith is always given what is treasured, and what is treasured is returned to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"173#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world can give you only what you gave it, for being nothing but your own projection, it has no meaning apart from what you found in it and placed your faith in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be faithful unto darkness and you will not see, because your faith will be rewarded as you gave it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You <i>will</i> accept your treasure, and if you place your faith in the past, the future will be like it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whatever you hold dear you think is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The power of your valuing will make it so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"173#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Atonement brings a re-evaluation of everything you cherish, for it is the means by which the Holy Spirit can separate the false and the true, which you have accepted into your mind without distinction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore you cannot value one without the other, and guilt has become as true for you as innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not believe the Son of God is guiltless because you see the past, and see him not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you condemn a brother you are saying, “I who was guilty choose to remain so.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have denied his freedom, and by so doing you have denied the witness unto yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You could as easily have freed him from the past, and lifted from his mind the cloud of guilt that binds him to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in his freedom would have been your own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"173#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Lay not his guilt upon him, for his guilt lies in his secret thought that he has done this unto you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you, then, teach him he is right in his delusion?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The idea that the guiltless Son of God can attack himself and make himself guilty is insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In any form, in anyone, <i>believe this not.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For sin and condemnation are the same, and the belief in one is faith in the other, calling for punishment instead of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing can justify insanity, and to call for punishment upon yourself must be insane.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"173#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>See no one, then, as guilty, and you will affirm the truth of guiltlessness unto yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In every condemnation that you offer the Son of God lies the conviction of your own guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you would have the Holy Spirit make you free of it, accept His offer of Atonement for all your brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For so you learn that it is true for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember always that it is impossible to condemn the Son of God in part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Those whom you see as guilty become the witnesses to guilt in you, and you will see it there, for it <i>is</i> there until it is undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Guilt is always in your mind, which has condemned itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Project it not, for while you do, it cannot be undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>With everyone whom you release from guilt great is the joy in Heaven, where the witnesses to your fatherhood rejoice.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"173#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Guilt makes you blind, for while you see one spot of guilt within you, you will not see the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And by projecting it the world seems dark, and shrouded in your guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You throw a dark veil over it, and cannot see it because you cannot look within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are afraid of what you would see there, but it is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span><i>The thing you fear is gone.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you would look within you would see only the Atonement, shining in quiet and in peace upon the altar to your Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"173#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not be afraid to look within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego tells you all is black with guilt within you, and bids you not to look.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Instead, it bids you look upon your brothers, and see the guilt in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet this you cannot do without remaining blind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For those who see their brothers in the dark, and guilty in the dark in which they shroud them, are too afraid to look upon the light within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Within you is not what you believe is there, and what you put your faith in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Within you is the holy sign of perfect faith your Father has in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He does not value you as you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He knows Himself, and knows the truth in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He knows there is no difference, for He knows not of differences.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Can you see guilt where God knows there is perfect innocence?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>You can deny His knowledge, but you cannot change it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"173#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Look, then, upon the light He placed within you, and learn that what you feared was there has been replaced with love.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Guilt remains the
