data-sentence-id=\"115#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only you can limit your creative power, but God wills to release it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He no more wills you to deprive yourself of your creations than He wills to deprive Himself of His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not withhold your gifts to the Sonship, or you withhold yourself from God!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Selfishness is of the ego, but Self-fullness is of spirit because that is how God created it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit is in the part of the mind that lies between the ego and the spirit, mediating between them always in favor of the spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To the ego this is partiality, and it responds as if it were being sided against.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To spirit this is truth, because it knows its fullness and cannot conceive of any part from which it is excluded.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"115#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Spirit knows that the awareness of all its brothers is included in its own, as it is included in God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The power of the whole Sonship and of its Creator is therefore spirit’s own fullness, rendering its creations equally whole and equal in perfection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego cannot prevail against a totality that includes God, and any totality <i>must</i> include God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everything He created is given all His power, because it is part of Him and shares His Being with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Creating is the opposite of loss, as blessing is the opposite of sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Being <i>must</i> be extended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is how it retains the knowledge of itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Spirit yearns to share its being as its Creator did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Created by sharing, its will is to create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It does not wish to contain God, but wills to extend His Being.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"115#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The extension of God’s Being is spirit’s only function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its fullness cannot be contained, any more than can the fullness of its Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fullness is extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego’s whole thought system blocks extension, and thus blocks your only function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It therefore blocks your joy, so that you perceive yourself as unfulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Unless you create you <i>are</i> unfulfilled, but God does not know unfulfillment and therefore you must create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You may not know your own creations, but this can no more interfere with their reality than your unawareness of your spirit can interfere with its being.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"115#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Kingdom is forever extending because it is in the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not know your joy because you do not know your own Self-fullness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Exclude any part of the Kingdom from yourself and you are not whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A split mind cannot perceive its fullness, and needs the miracle of its wholeness to dawn upon it and heal it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This reawakens the wholeness in it, and restores it to the Kingdom because of its acceptance of wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The full appreciation of the mind’s Self-fullness makes selfishness impossible and extension inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is why there is perfect peace in the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Spirit is fulfilling its function, and only complete fulfillment is peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"115#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your creations are protected for you because the Holy Spirit, Who is in your mind, knows of them and can bring them into your awareness whenever you will let Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are there as part of your own being, because your fulfillment includes them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The creations of every Son of God are yours, since every creation belongs to everyone, being created for the Sonship as a whole.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"115#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have not failed to increase the inheritance of the Sons of God, and thus have not failed to secure it for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Since it was the Will of God to give it to you, He gave it forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Since it was His Will that you have it forever, He gave you the means for keeping it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span><i>And you have done so.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Disobeying God’s Will is meaningful only to the insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In truth it is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your Self-fullness is as boundless as God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Like His, It extends forever and in perfect peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Its radiance is so intense that It creates in perfect joy, and only the whole can be born of Its Wholeness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"115#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be confident that you have never lost your Identity and the extensions which maintain It in wholeness and peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Miracles are an expression of this confidence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are reflections of both your proper identification with your brothers, and of your awareness that your identification is maintained by extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle is a lesson in total perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"115#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>By including any part of totality in the lesson, you have included the whole.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Only you can limit your creative power, but God wills to release it.
