a space between all things, between all things and you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"592#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus do you think that you have given life in separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"592#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By this split you think you are established as a unity which functions with an independent will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"592#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"592#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What are these names by which the world becomes a series of discrete events, of things ununified, of bodies kept apart and holding bits of mind as separate awarenesses?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"592#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You gave these names to them, establishing perception as you wished to have perception be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"592#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The nameless things were given names, and thus reality was given them as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"592#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For what is named is given meaning and will then be seen as meaningful;
