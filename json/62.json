Defense","inlineNumber":"II."},"annotation":"T-2.II","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-2-sect-2\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"062#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can do anything I ask.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I have asked you to perform miracles, and have made it clear that miracles are natural, corrective, healing and universal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is nothing they cannot do, but they cannot be performed in the spirit of doubt or fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you are afraid of anything, you are acknowledging its power to hurt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember that where your heart is, there is your treasure also.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You believe in what you value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you are afraid, you are valuing wrongly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your understanding will then inevitably value wrongly, and by endowing all thoughts with equal power will inevitably destroy peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That is why the Bible speaks of “the peace of God which passeth understanding.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This peace is totally incapable of being shaken by errors of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It denies the ability of anything not of God to affect you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>This is the proper use of denial.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>It is not used to hide anything, but to correct error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#1:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>It brings all error into the light, and since error and darkness are the same, it corrects error automatically.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"062#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>True denial is a powerful protective device.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can and should deny any belief that error can hurt you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This kind of denial is not a concealment but a correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your right mind depends on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Denial of error is a strong defense of truth, but denial of truth results in miscreation, the projections of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In the service of the right mind the denial of error frees the mind, and re-establishes the freedom of the will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When the will is really free it cannot miscreate, because it recognizes only truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"062#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can defend truth as well as error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The means are easier to understand after the value of the goal is firmly established.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a question of what it is <i>for.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everyone defends his treasure, and will do so automatically.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The real questions are, what do you treasure, and how much do you treasure it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Once you have learned to consider these questions and to bring them into all your actions, you will have little difficulty in clarifying the means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The means are available whenever you ask.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You can, however, save time if you do not protract this step unduly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The correct focus will shorten it immeasurably.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"062#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Atonement is the only defense that cannot be used destructively because it is not a device you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Atonement <i>principle</i> was in effect long before the Atonement began.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The principle was love and the Atonement was an <i>act</i> of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Acts were not necessary before the separation, because belief in space and time did not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It was only after the separation that the Atonement and the conditions necessary for its fulfillment were planned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then a defense so splendid was needed that it could not be misused, although it could be refused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Refusal could not, however, turn it into a weapon of attack, which is the inherent characteristic of other defenses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Atonement thus becomes the only defense that is not a two-edged sword.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It can only heal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"062#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Atonement was built into the space-time belief to set a limit on the need for the belief itself, and ultimately to make learning complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Atonement is the final lesson.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Learning itself, like the classrooms in which it occurs, is temporary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ability to learn has no value when change is no longer necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The eternally creative have nothing to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can learn to improve your perceptions, and can become a better and better learner.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This will bring you into closer and closer accord with the Sonship; but the Sonship itself is a perfect creation and perfection is not a matter of degree.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Only while there is a belief in differences is learning meaningful.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"062#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Evolution is a process in which you seem to proceed from one degree to the next.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You correct your previous missteps by stepping forward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This process is actually incomprehensible in temporal terms, because you return as you go forward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Atonement is the device by which you can free yourself from the past as you go ahead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It undoes your past errors, thus making it unnecessary for you to keep retracing your steps without advancing to your return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In this sense the Atonement saves time, but like the miracle it serves, does not abolish it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As long as there is need for Atonement, there is need for time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But the Atonement as a completed plan has a unique relationship to time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Until the Atonement is complete, its various phases will proceed in time, but the whole Atonement stands at time’s end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>At that point the bridge of return has been built.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"062#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Atonement is a total commitment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You may still think this is associated with loss, a mistake all the separated Sons of God make in one way or another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is hard to believe a defense that cannot attack is the best defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is what is meant by “the meek shall inherit the earth.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They will literally take it over because of their strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A two-way defense is inherently weak precisely because it has two edges, and can be turned against you very unexpectedly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This possibility cannot be controlled except by miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"062#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The miracle turns the defense of Atonement to your real protection, and as you become more and more secure you assume your natural talent of protecting others, knowing yourself as both a brother and a Son.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You can do anything I ask.
