It","inlineNumber":"A."},"annotation":"T-19.IV-A","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-19-sect-4-sub-a\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"233#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The first obstacle that peace must flow across is your desire to get rid of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it cannot extend unless you keep it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are the center from which it radiates outward, to call the others in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are its home; its tranquil dwelling place from which it gently reaches out, but never leaving you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you would make it homeless, how can it abide within the Son of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it would spread across the whole creation, it must begin with you, and from you reach to everyone who calls, and bring him rest by joining you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"233#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why would you want peace homeless?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What do you think that it must dispossess to dwell with you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What seems to be the cost you are so unwilling to pay?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The little barrier of sand still stands between you and your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would you reinforce it now?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are not asked to let it go for yourself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Christ asks it of you for Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He would bring peace to everyone, and how can He do this except through you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Would you let a little bank of sand, a wall of dust, a tiny seeming barrier, stand between your brothers and salvation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And yet, this little remnant of attack you cherish still against your brother <i>is</i> the first obstacle the peace in you encounters in its going forth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This little wall of hatred would still oppose the Will of God, and keep it limited.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"233#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s purpose rests in peace within you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you are still unwilling to let it join you wholly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You still oppose the Will of God, just by a little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And that little is a limit you would place upon the whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s Will is One, not many.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It has no opposition, for there is none beside it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What you would still contain behind your little barrier and keep separate from your brother seems mightier than the universe, for it would hold back the universe and its Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This little wall would hide the purpose of Heaven, and keep it <i>from</i> Heaven.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"233#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you thrust salvation away from the giver of salvation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For such have you become.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Peace could no more depart from you than from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fear not this little obstacle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It cannot contain the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Peace will flow across it, and join you without hindrance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Salvation cannot be withheld from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is your purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You cannot choose apart from this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You have no purpose apart from your brother, nor apart from the one you asked the Holy Spirit to share with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The little wall will fall away so quietly beneath the wings of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>For peace will send its messengers from you to all the world, and barriers will fall away before their coming as easily as those that you interpose will be surmounted.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"233#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To overcome the world is no more difficult than to surmount your little wall.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For in the miracle of your holy relationship, without this barrier, is every miracle contained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no order of difficulty in miracles, for they are all the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each is a gentle winning over from the appeal of guilt to the appeal of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How can this fail to be accomplished, wherever it is undertaken?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Guilt can raise no real barriers against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And all that seems to stand between you and your brother must fall away because of the appeal you answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>From you who answered, He Who answered you would call.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>His home is in your holy relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Do not attempt to stand between Him and His holy purpose, for it is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>But let Him quietly extend the miracle of your relationship to everyone contained in it as it was given.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"233#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a hush in Heaven, a happy expectancy, a little pause of gladness in acknowledgment of the journey’s end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For Heaven knows you well, as you know Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No illusions stand between you and your brother now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Look not upon the little wall of shadows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The sun has risen over it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How can a shadow keep you from the sun?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No more can you be kept by shadows from the light in which illusions end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Every miracle is but the end of an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Such was the journey; such its ending.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And in the goal of truth which you accepted must all illusions end.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"233#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The little insane wish to get rid of Him Whom you invited in and push Him out <i>must</i> produce conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As you look upon the world, this little wish, uprooted and floating aimlessly, can land and settle briefly upon anything, for it has no purpose now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Before the Holy Spirit entered to abide with you it seemed to have a mighty purpose; the fixed and unchangeable dedication to sin and its results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now it is aimless, wandering pointlessly, causing no more than tiny interruptions in love’s appeal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"233#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This feather of a wish, this tiny illusion, this microscopic remnant of the belief in sin, is all that remains of what once seemed to be the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is no longer an unrelenting barrier to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its pointless wandering makes its results appear to be more erratic and unpredictable than before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet what could be more unstable than a tightly organized delusional system?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its seeming stability is its pervasive weakness, which extends to everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The variability the little remnant induces merely indicates its limited results.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"233#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How mighty can a little feather be before the great wings of truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can it oppose an eagle’s flight, or hinder the advance of summer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Can it interfere with the effects of summer’s sun upon a garden covered by the snow?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>See but how easily this little wisp is lifted up and carried away, never to return, and part with it in gladness, not regret.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it is nothing in itself, and stood for nothing when you had greater faith in its protection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"233#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Would you not rather greet the summer sun than fix your gaze upon a disappearing snowflake, and shiver in remembrance of the winter’s cold?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The first obstacle that peace must flow across is your desire to get rid of it.
