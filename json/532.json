data-sentence-id=\"532#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps you think that different kinds of love are possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you think there is a kind of love for this, a kind for that; a way of loving one, another way of loving still another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Love is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It has no separate parts and no degrees; no kinds nor levels, no divergencies and no distinctions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is like itself, unchanged throughout.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It never alters with a person or a circumstance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is the Heart of God, and also of His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Love’s meaning is obscure to anyone who thinks that love can change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He does not see that changing love must be impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus he thinks that he can love at times, and hate at other times.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He also thinks that love can be bestowed on one, and yet remain itself although it is withheld from others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To believe these things of love is not to understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it could make such distinctions, it would have to judge between the righteous and the sinner, and perceive the Son of God in separate parts.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Love cannot judge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As it is one itself, it looks on all as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its meaning lies in oneness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it must elude the mind that thinks of it as partial or in part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no love but God’s, and all of love is His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no other principle that rules where love is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Love is a law without an opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Its wholeness is the power holding everything as one, the link between the Father and the Son which holds Them both forever as the same.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No course whose purpose is to teach you to remember what you really are could fail to emphasize that there can never be a difference in what you really are and what love is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love’s meaning is your own, and shared by God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what you are is what He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no love but His, and what He is, is everything there is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no limit placed upon Himself, and so are you unlimited as well.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No law the world obeys can help you grasp love’s meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What the world believes was made to hide love’s meaning, and to keep it dark and secret.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is not one principle the world upholds but violates the truth of what love is, and what you are as well.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Seek not within the world to find your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love is not found in darkness and in death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it is perfectly apparent to the eyes that see and ears that hear love’s Voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Today we practice making free your mind of all the laws you think you must obey; of all the limits under which you live, and all the changes that you think are part of human destiny.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Today we take the largest single step this course requests in your advance towards its established goal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you achieve the faintest glimmering of what love means today, you have advanced in distance without measure and in time beyond the count of years to your release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us together, then, be glad to give some time to God today, and understand there is no better use for time than this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For fifteen minutes twice today escape from every law in which you now believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Open your mind and rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world that seems to hold you prisoner can be escaped by anyone who does not hold it dear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Withdraw all value you have placed upon its meager offerings and senseless gifts, and let the gift of God replace them all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Call to your Father, certain that His Voice will answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He Himself has promised this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And He Himself will place a spark of truth within your mind wherever you give up a false belief, a dark illusion of your own reality and what love means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He will shine through your idle thoughts today, and help you understand the truth of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In loving gentleness He will abide with you, as you allow His Voice to teach love’s meaning to your clean and open mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And He will bless the lesson with His Love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today the legion of the future years of waiting for salvation disappears before the timelessness of what you learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us give thanks today that we are spared a future like the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Today we leave the past behind us, nevermore to be remembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And we raise our eyes upon a different present, where a future dawns unlike the past in every attribute.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world in infancy is newly born.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And we will watch it grow in health and strength, to shed its blessing upon all who come to learn to cast aside the world they thought was made in hate to be love’s enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Now are they all made free, along with us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now are they all our brothers in God’s Love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"532#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will remember them throughout the day, because we cannot leave a part of us outside our love if we would know our Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>At least three times an hour think of one who makes the journey with you, and who came to learn what you must learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And as he comes to mind, give him this message from your Self:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"532#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I bless you, brother, with the Love of God, which I would share with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"532#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For I would learn the joyous lesson that there is no love but God’s and yours and mine and everyone’s.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Perhaps you think that different kinds of love are possible.
