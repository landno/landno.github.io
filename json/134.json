Brother","inlineNumber":"VI."},"annotation":"T-9.VI","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-9-sect-6\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"134#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can you become increasingly aware of the Holy Spirit in you except by His effects?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot see Him with your eyes nor hear Him with your ears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How, then, can you perceive Him at all?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you inspire joy and others react to you with joy, even though you are not experiencing joy yourself there must be something in you that is capable of producing it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If it is in you and can produce joy, and if you see that it does produce joy in others, you must be dissociating it in yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"134#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It seems to you that the Holy Spirit does not produce joy consistently in you only because you do not consistently arouse joy in others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Their reactions to you are your evaluations of His consistency.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you are inconsistent you will not always give rise to joy, and so you will not always recognize His consistency.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you offer to your brother you offer to Him, because He cannot go beyond your offering in His giving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is not because He limits His giving, but simply because you have limited your receiving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The decision to receive is the decision to accept.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"134#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If your brothers are part of you, will you accept them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only they can teach you what you are, for your learning is the result of what you taught them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What you call upon in them you call upon in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And as you call upon it in them it becomes real to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God has but one Son, knowing them all as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only God Himself is more than they but they are not less than He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Would you know what this means?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If what you do to my brother you do to me, and if you do everything for yourself because we are part of you, everything we do belongs to you as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Everyone God created is part of you and shares His glory with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>His glory belongs to Him, but it is equally yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You cannot, then, be less glorious than He is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"134#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God is more than you only because He created you, but not even this would He keep from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore you can create as He did, and your dissociation will not alter this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Neither God’s light nor yours is dimmed because you do not see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Because the Sonship must create as one, you remember creation whenever you recognize part of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each part you remember adds to your wholeness because each part <i>is</i> whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Wholeness is indivisible, but you cannot learn of your wholeness until you see it everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You can know yourself only as God knows His Son, for knowledge is shared with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>When you awake in Him you will know your magnitude by accepting His limitlessness as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But meanwhile you will judge it as you judge your brother’s, and will accept it as you accept his.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"134#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are not yet awake, but you can learn how to awaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Very simply, the Holy Spirit teaches you to awaken others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As you see them waken you will learn what waking means, and because you have chosen to wake them, their gratitude and their appreciation of what you have given them will teach you its value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They will become the witnesses to your reality, as you were created witness to God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet when the Sonship comes together and accepts its Oneness it will be known by its creations, who witness to its reality as the Son does to the Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"134#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Miracles have no place in eternity, because they are reparative.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet while you still need healing, your miracles are the only witnesses to your reality that you can recognize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot perform a miracle for yourself, because miracles are a way of giving acceptance and receiving it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In time the giving comes first, though they are simultaneous in eternity, where they cannot be separated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When you have learned they are the same, the need for time is over.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"134#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Eternity is one time, its only dimension being “always.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This cannot mean anything to you until you remember God’s open Arms, and finally know His open Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Like Him, <i>you</i> are “always”; in His Mind and with a mind like His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In your open mind are your creations, in perfect communication born of perfect understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Could you but accept one of them you would not want anything the world has to offer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Everything else would be totally meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God’s meaning is incomplete without you, and you are incomplete without your creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Accept your brother in this world and accept nothing else, for in him you will find your creations because he created them with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"134#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You will never know that you are co-creator with God until you learn that your brother is co-creator with you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"How can you become increasingly aware of the Holy Spirit in you except by His effects?
