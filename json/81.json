Autonomy","inlineNumber":"II."},"annotation":"T-4.II","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-4-sect-2\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is reasonable to ask how the mind could ever have made the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In fact, it is the best question you could ask.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is, however, no point in giving an answer in terms of the past because the past does not matter, and history would not exist if the same errors were not being repeated in the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Abstract thought applies to knowledge because knowledge is completely impersonal, and examples are irrelevant to its understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perception, however, is always specific, and therefore quite concrete.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone makes an ego or a self for himself, which is subject to enormous variation because of its instability.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He also makes an ego for everyone else he perceives, which is equally variable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Their interaction is a process that alters both, because they were not made by or with the Unalterable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is important to realize that this alteration can and does occur as readily when the interaction takes place in the mind as when it involves physical proximity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thinking about another ego is as effective in changing relative perception as is physical interaction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There could be no better example that the ego is only an idea and not a fact.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your own state of mind is a good example of how the ego was made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you threw knowledge away it is as if you never had it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is so apparent that one need only recognize it to see that it does happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If this occurs in the present, why is it surprising that it occurred in the past?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Surprise is a reasonable response to the unfamiliar, though hardly to something that occurs with such persistence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But do not forget that the mind need not work that way, even though it does work that way now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think of the love of animals for their offspring, and the need they feel to protect them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is because they regard them as part of themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one dismisses something he considers part of himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You react to your ego much as God does to His creations,—with love, protection and charity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your reactions to the self you made are not surprising.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In fact, they resemble in many ways how you will one day react to your real creations, which are as timeless as you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The question is not how you respond to the ego, but what you believe you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Belief is an ego function, and as long as your origin is open to belief you are regarding it from an ego viewpoint.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>When teaching is no longer necessary you will merely know God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Belief that there is another way of perceiving is the loftiest idea of which ego thinking is capable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>That is because it contains a hint of recognition that the ego is not the Self.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Undermining the ego’s thought system must be perceived as painful, even though this is anything but true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Babies scream in rage if you take away a knife or scissors, although they may well harm themselves if you do not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In this sense you are still a baby.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have no sense of real self-preservation, and are likely to decide that you need precisely what would hurt you most.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet whether or not you recognize it now, you have agreed to cooperate in the effort to become both harmless and helpful, attributes that must go together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your attitudes even toward this are necessarily conflicted, because all attitudes are ego-based.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This will not last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Be patient a while and remember that the outcome is as certain as God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only those who have a real and lasting sense of abundance can be truly charitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is obvious when you consider what is involved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To the ego, to give anything implies that you will have to do without it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you associate giving with sacrifice, you give only because you believe that you are somehow getting something better, and can therefore do without the thing you give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>“Giving to get” is an inescapable law of the ego, which always evaluates itself in relation to other egos.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is therefore continually preoccupied with the belief in scarcity that gave rise to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Its whole perception of other egos as real is only an attempt to convince itself that <i>it</i> is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>“Self-esteem” in ego terms means nothing more than that the ego has deluded itself into accepting its reality, and is therefore temporarily less predatory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This “self-esteem” is always vulnerable to stress, a term which refers to any perceived threat to the ego’s existence.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego literally lives by comparisons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Equality is beyond its grasp, and charity becomes impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego never gives out of abundance, because it was made as a substitute for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is why the concept of “getting” arose in the ego’s thought system.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Appetites are “getting” mechanisms, representing the ego’s need to confirm itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is as true of body appetites as it is of the so-called “higher ego needs.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Body appetites are not physical in origin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego regards the body as its home, and tries to satisfy itself through the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But the idea that this is possible is a decision of the mind, which has become completely confused about what is really possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego believes it is completely on its own, which is merely another way of describing how it thinks it originated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is such a fearful state that it can only turn to other egos and try to unite with them in a feeble attempt at identification, or attack them in an equally feeble show of strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not free, however, to open the premise to question, because the premise is its foundation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego is the mind’s belief that it is completely on its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego’s ceaseless attempts to gain the spirit’s acknowledgment and thus establish its own existence are useless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Spirit in its knowledge is unaware of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It does not attack it; it merely cannot conceive of it at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>While the ego is equally unaware of spirit, it does perceive itself as being rejected by something greater than itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is why self-esteem in ego terms must be delusional.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The creations of God do not create myths, although creative effort can be turned to mythology.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It can do so, however, only under one condition; what it makes is then no longer creative.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Myths are entirely perceptual, and so ambiguous in form and characteristically good-and-evil in nature that the most benevolent of them is not without fearful connotations.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Myths and magic are closely associated, since myths are usually related to ego origins, and magic to the powers the ego ascribes to itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Mythological systems generally include some account of “the creation,” and associate this with its particular form of magic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The so-called “battle for survival” is only the ego’s struggle to preserve itself, and its interpretation of its own beginning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This beginning is usually associated with physical birth, because it is hard to maintain that the ego existed before that point in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The more “religiously” ego-oriented may believe that the soul existed before, and will continue to exist after a temporary lapse into ego life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Some even believe that the soul will be punished for this lapse.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>However, salvation does not apply to spirit, which is not in danger and does not need to be salvaged.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation is nothing more than “right-mindedness,” which is not the One-mindedness of the Holy Spirit, but which must be achieved before One-mindedness is restored.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Right-mindedness leads to the next step automatically, because right perception is uniformly without attack, and therefore wrong-mindedness is obliterated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego cannot survive without judgment, and is laid aside accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The mind then has only one direction in which it can move.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its direction is always automatic, because it cannot but be dictated by the thought system to which it adheres.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"081#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It cannot be emphasized too often that correcting perception is merely a temporary expedient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is necessary only because misperception is a block to knowledge, while accurate perception is a steppingstone towards it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The whole value of right perception lies in the inevitable realization that <i>all</i> perception is unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This removes the block entirely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You may ask how this is possible as long as you appear to be living in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is a reasonable question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You must be careful, however, that you really understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Who is the “you” who are living in this world?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Spirit is immortal, and immortality is a constant state.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is as true now as it ever was or ever will be, because it implies no change at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It is not a continuum, nor is it understood by being compared to an opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Knowledge never involves comparisons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"081#11:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>That is its main difference from everything else the mind can grasp.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is reasonable to ask how the
