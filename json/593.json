data-sentence-id=\"593#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To say these words is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But to mean these words is everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you could but mean them for just an instant, there would be no further sorrow possible for you in any form; in any place or time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Heaven would be completely given back to full awareness, memory of God entirely restored, the resurrection of all creation fully recognized.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can mean these words and not be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He cannot play with dreams, nor think he is himself a dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He cannot make a hell and think it real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He wants the peace of God, and it is given him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For that is all he wants, and that is all he will receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Many have said these words.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But few indeed have meant them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You have but to look upon the world you see around you to be sure how very few they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The world would be completely changed, should any two agree these words express the only thing they want.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Two minds with one intent become so strong that what they will becomes the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For minds can only join in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In dreams, no two can share the same intent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To each, the hero of the dream is different; the outcome wanted not the same for both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Loser and gainer merely shift about in changing patterns, as the ratio of gain to loss and loss to gain takes on a different aspect or another form.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet compromise alone a dream can bring.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Sometimes it takes the form of union, but only the form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The meaning must escape the dream, for compromising is the goal of dreaming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Minds cannot unite in dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They merely bargain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what bargain can give them the peace of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Illusions come to take His place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And what He means is lost to sleeping minds intent on compromise, each to his gain and to another’s loss.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To mean you want the peace of God is to renounce all dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For no one means these words who wants illusions, and who therefore seeks the means which bring illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has looked on them, and found them wanting.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now he seeks to go beyond them, recognizing that another dream would offer nothing more than all the others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Dreams are one to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And he has learned their only difference is one of form, for one will bring the same despair and misery as do the rest.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The mind which means that all it wants is peace must join with other minds, for that is how peace is obtained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And when the wish for peace is genuine, the means for finding it is given, in a form each mind that seeks for it in honesty can understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whatever form the lesson takes is planned for him in such a way that he can not mistake it, if his asking is sincere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But if he asks without sincerity, there is no form in which the lesson will meet with acceptance and be truly learned.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us today devote our practicing to recognizing that we really mean the words we say.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We want the peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is no idle wish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>These words do not request another dream be given us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They do not ask for compromise, nor try to make another bargain in the hope that there may yet be one that can succeed where all the rest have failed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To mean these words acknowledges illusions are in vain, requesting the eternal in the place of shifting dreams which seem to change in what they offer, but are one in nothingness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today devote your practice periods to careful searching of your mind, to find the dreams you cherish still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What do you ask for in your heart?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forget the words you use in making your requests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Consider but what you believe will comfort you, and bring you happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But be you not dismayed by lingering illusions, for their form is not what matters now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let not some dreams be more acceptable, reserving shame and secrecy for others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And being one, one question should be asked of all of them, “Is this what I would have, in place of Heaven and the peace of God?”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the choice you make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be not deceived that it is otherwise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No compromise is possible in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You choose God’s peace, or you have asked for dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And dreams will come as you requested them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet will God’s peace come just as certainly, and to remain with you forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It will not be gone with every twist and turning of the road, to reappear, unrecognized, in forms which shift and change with every step you take.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You want the peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so do all who seem to seek for dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For them as well as for yourself, you ask but this when you make this request with deep sincerity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For thus you reach to what they really want, and join your own intent with what they seek above all things, perhaps unknown to them, but sure to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have been weak at times, uncertain in your purpose, and unsure of what you wanted, where to look for it, and where to turn for help in the attempt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Help has been given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And would you not avail yourself of it by sharing it?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one who truly seeks the peace of God can fail to find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For he merely asks that he deceive himself no longer by denying to himself what is God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who can remain unsatisfied who asks for what he has already?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who could be unanswered who requests an answer which is his to give?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The peace of God is yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For you was peace created, given you by its Creator, and established as His Own eternal gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How can you fail, when you but ask for what He wills for you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And how could your request be limited to you alone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No gift of God can be unshared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this attribute that sets the gifts of God apart from every dream that ever seemed to take the place of truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can lose and everyone must gain whenever any gift of God has been requested and received by anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God gives but to unite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To take away is meaningless to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And when it is as meaningless to you, you can be sure you share one Will with Him, and He with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you will also know you share one Will with all your brothers, whose intent is yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"593#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is this one intent we seek today, uniting our desires with the need of every heart, the call of every mind, the hope that lies beyond despair, the love attack would hide, the brotherhood that hate has sought to sever, but which still remains as God created it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"593#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>With Help like this beside us, can we fail today as we request the peace of God be given us?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"To
