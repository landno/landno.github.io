data-sentence-id=\"310#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The only way to heal is to be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The miracle extends without your help, but you are needed that it can begin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Accept the miracle of healing, and it will go forth because of what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is its nature to extend itself the instant it is born.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is born the instant it is offered and received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No one can ask another to be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But he can let <i>himself</i> be healed, and thus offer the other what he has received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Who can bestow upon another what he does not have?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And who can share what he denies himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The Holy Spirit speaks to <i>you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>He does not speak to someone else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Yet by your listening His Voice extends, because you have accepted what He says.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Health is the witness unto health.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As long as it is unattested, it remains without conviction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only when it has been demonstrated is it proved, and must provide a witness that compels belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one is healed through double messages.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you wish only to be healed, you heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your single purpose makes this possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But if you are afraid of healing, then it cannot come through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The only thing that is required for a healing is a lack of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The fearful are not healed, and cannot heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This does not mean the conflict must be gone forever from your mind to heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>For if it were, there were no need for healing then.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>But it does mean, if only for an instant, you love without attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>An instant is sufficient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#2:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>Miracles wait not on time.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant is the miracle’s abiding place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From there, each one is born into this world as witness to a state of mind that has transcended conflict, and has reached to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It carries comfort from the place of peace into the battleground, and demonstrates that war has no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For all the hurt that war has sought to bring, the broken bodies and the shattered limbs, the screaming dying and the silent dead, are gently lifted up and comforted.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no sadness where a miracle has come to heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And nothing more than just one instant of your love without attack is necessary that all this occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In that one instant you are healed, and in that single instant is all healing done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What stands apart from you, when you accept the blessing that the holy instant brings?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be not afraid of blessing, for the One Who blesses you loves all the world, and leaves nothing within the world that could be feared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But if you shrink from blessing, will the world indeed seem fearful, for you have withheld its peace and comfort, leaving it to die.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would not a world so bitterly bereft be looked on as a condemnation by the one who could have saved it, but stepped back because he was afraid of being healed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The eyes of all the dying bring reproach, and suffering whispers, “What is there to fear?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Consider well its question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is asked of you on your behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A dying world asks only that you rest an instant from attack upon yourself, that it be healed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Come to the holy instant and be healed, for nothing that is there received is left behind on your returning to the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And being blessed you will bring blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Life is given you to give the dying world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And suffering eyes no longer will accuse, but shine in thanks to you who blessing gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The holy instant’s radiance will light your eyes, and give them sight to see beyond all suffering and see Christ’s face instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Healing replaces suffering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who looks on one cannot perceive the other, for they cannot both be there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And what you see the world will witness, and will witness to.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus is your healing everything the world requires, that it may be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It needs one lesson that has perfectly been learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And then, when you forget it, will the world remind you gently of what you have taught.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No reinforcement will its thanks withhold from you who let yourself be healed that it might live.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It will call forth its witnesses to show the face of Christ to you who brought the sight to them, by which they witnessed it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The world of accusation is replaced by one in which all eyes look lovingly upon the Friend who brought them their release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And happily your brother will perceive the many friends he thought were enemies.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Problems are not specific but they take specific forms, and these specific shapes make up the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And no one understands the nature of his problem.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If he did, it would be there no more for him to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its very nature is that it is <i>not.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus, while he perceives it he can not perceive it as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But healing is apparent in specific instances, and generalizes to include them all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is because they really are the same, despite their different forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All learning aims at transfer, which becomes complete within two situations that are seen as one, for only common elements are there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet this can only be attained by One Who does not see the differences you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The total transfer of your learning is not made by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>But that it has been made in spite of all the differences you see, convinces you that they could not be real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your healing will extend, and will be brought to problems that you thought were not your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it will also be apparent that your many different problems will be solved as any one of them has been escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It cannot be their differences which made this possible, for learning does not jump from situations to their opposites and bring the same results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All healing must proceed in lawful manner, in accord with laws that have been properly perceived but never violated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Fear you not the way that you perceive them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are wrong, but there is One within you Who is right.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Leave, then, the transfer of your learning to the One Who really understands its laws, and Who will guarantee that they remain unviolated and unlimited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your part is merely to apply what He has taught you to yourself, and He will do the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And it is thus the power of your learning will be proved to you by all the many different witnesses it finds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your brother first among them will be seen, but thousands stand behind him, and beyond each one of them there are a thousand more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each one may seem to have a problem that is different from the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet they are solved together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And their common answer shows the questions could not have been separate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"310#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Peace be to you to whom is healing offered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you will learn that peace is given you when you accept the healing for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its total value need not be appraised by you to let you understand that you have benefited from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What occurred within the instant that love entered in without attack will stay with you forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your healing will be one of its effects, as will your brother’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Everywhere you go, will you behold its multiplied effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet all the witnesses that you behold will be far less than all there really are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Infinity cannot be understood by merely counting up its separate parts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"310#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>God thanks you for your healing, for He knows it is a gift of love unto His Son, and therefore is it given unto Him.</span></p></div>
