class=\"snr\">4</span>What is the <i>ego</i>?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But a dream of what you really are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A thought you are apart from your Creator and a wish to be what He created not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is a thing of madness, not reality at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>A name for namelessness is all it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>A symbol of impossibility; a choice for options that do not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>We name it but to help us understand that it is nothing but an ancient thought that what is made has immortality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>But what could come of this except a dream which, like all dreams, can only end in death?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"853#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is the ego?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothingness, but in a form that seems like something.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In a world of form the ego cannot be denied for it alone seems real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet could God’s Son as He created him abide in form or in a world of form?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who asks you to define the ego and explain how it arose can be but he who thinks it real, and seeks by definition to ensure that its illusive nature is concealed behind the words that seem to make it so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"853#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no definition for a lie that serves to make it true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor can there be a truth that lies conceal effectively.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego’s unreality is not denied by words nor is its meaning clear because its nature seems to have a form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who can define the undefinable?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And yet there is an answer even here.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"853#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We cannot really make a definition for what the ego is, but we <i>can</i> say what it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this is shown to us with perfect clarity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is from this that we deduce all that the ego is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Look at its opposite and you can see the only answer that is meaningful.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"853#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s opposite in every way,—in origin, effect and consequence—we call a miracle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And here we find all that is not the ego in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here is the ego’s opposite and here alone we look on what the ego was, for here we see all that it seemed to do, and cause and its effects must still be one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"853#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Where there

darkness was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where is the ego?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Where the darkness was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What is it now and where can it be found?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing and nowhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Now the light has come: Its opposite has gone without a trace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Where evil was there now is holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What is the ego?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>What the evil was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Where is the ego?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>In an evil dream that but seemed real while you were dreaming it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>Where there was crucifixion stands God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>What is the ego?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:16\"><span class=\"snr\">16</span>Who has need to ask?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:17\"><span class=\"snr\">17</span>Where is the ego?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#6:18\"><span class=\"snr\">18</span>Who has need to seek for an illusion now that dreams are gone?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"853#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is a

of <i>this</i> dream and you will never question any more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Look at the kindly world you see extend before you as you walk in gentleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Look at the helpers all along the way you travel, happy in the certainty of Heaven and the surety of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And look an instant, too, on what you left behind at last and finally passed by.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"853#8\"><p

pain, the fear of dying and the urge to kill, the brotherless illusion and the self that seemed alone in all the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This terrible mistake about yourself the miracle corrects as gently as a loving mother sings her child to rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is not a song like this what you would hear?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would it not answer all you thought to ask, and even make the question meaningless?</span></p></div> <div

still God’s Voice, which asks of everyone one question only: “Are you ready yet to help Me save the world?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Ask this instead of what the ego is, and you will see a sudden brightness cover up the world the ego made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No miracle is now withheld from anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The world is saved from what you thought it was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what it is, is wholly uncondemned and wholly pure.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"853#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle forgives; the ego damns.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Neither need be defined except by this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet could a definition be more sure, or more in line with what salvation is?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Problem and answer lie together here, and having met at last the choice is clear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who chooses hell when it is recognized?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"853#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And who would not go on a little while when it is given him to understand the way is short and Heaven is his goal?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Illusions will not last.
