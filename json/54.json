data-sentence-id=\"054#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It reflects the original form of communication between God and His creations, involving the extremely personal sense of creation sometimes sought in physical relationships.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Physical closeness cannot achieve it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Miracles, however, are genuinely interpersonal, and result in true closeness to others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Revelation unites you directly with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Miracles unite you directly with your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Neither emanates from consciousness, but both are experienced there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Consciousness is the state that induces action, though it does not inspire it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You are free to believe what you choose, and what you do attests to what you believe.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"054#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Revelation is intensely personal and cannot be meaningfully translated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is why any attempt to describe it in words is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Revelation induces only experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Miracles, on the other hand, induce action.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are more useful now because of their interpersonal nature.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In this phase of learning, working miracles is important because freedom from fear cannot be thrust upon you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Revelation is literally unspeakable because it is an experience of unspeakable love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"054#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Awe should be reserved for revelation, to which it is perfectly and correctly applicable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not appropriate for miracles because a state of awe is worshipful, implying that one of a lesser order stands before his Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are a perfect creation, and should experience awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle is therefore a sign of love among equals.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Equals should not be in awe of one another because awe implies inequality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is therefore an inappropriate reaction to me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>An elder brother is entitled to respect for his greater experience, and obedience for his greater wisdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is also entitled to love because he is a brother, and to devotion if he is devoted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is only my devotion that entitles me to yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>There is nothing about me that you cannot attain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>I have nothing that does not come from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The difference between us now is that I have nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#3:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>This leaves me in a state which is only potential in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"054#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>“No man cometh unto the Father but by me” does not mean that I am in any way separate or different from you except in time, and time does not really exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The statement is more meaningful in terms of a vertical rather than a horizontal axis.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You stand below me and I stand below God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the process of “rising up,” I am higher because without me the distance between God and man would be too great for you to encompass.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I bridge the distance as an elder brother to you on the one hand, and as a Son of God on the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>My devotion to my brothers has placed me in charge of the Sonship, which I render complete because I share it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This may appear to contradict the statement “I and my Father are one,” but there are two parts to the statement in recognition that the Father is greater.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"054#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Revelations are indirectly inspired by me because I am close to the Holy Spirit, and alert to the revelation-readiness of my brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I can thus bring down to them more than they can draw down to themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit mediates higher to lower communication, keeping the direct channel from God to you open for revelation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Revelation is not reciprocal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It proceeds from God to you, but not from you to God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"054#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle minimizes the need for time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the longitudinal or horizontal plane the recognition of the equality of the members of the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>However, the miracle entails a sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This introduces an interval from which the giver and receiver both emerge farther along in time than they would otherwise have been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The miracle thus has the unique property of abolishing time to the extent that it renders the interval of time it spans unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no relationship between the time a miracle takes and the time it covers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The miracle substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands of years.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It does so by the underlying recognition of perfect equality of giver and receiver on which the miracle rests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The miracle shortens time by collapsing it, thus eliminating certain intervals within it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"054#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It does this, however, within the larger temporal sequence.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Revelation induces complete but temporary suspension of doubt and fear.
