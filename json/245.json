data-sentence-id=\"245#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing can hurt you unless you give it the power to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet <i>you</i> give power as the laws of this world interpret giving; as you give you lose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not up to you to give power at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Power is of God, given by Him and reawakened by the Holy Spirit, Who knows that as you give you gain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He gives no power to sin, and therefore it has none; nor to its results as this world sees them,—sickness and death and misery and pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>These things have not occurred because the Holy Spirit sees them not, and gives no power to their seeming source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Thus would He keep you free of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Being without illusion of what you are, the Holy Spirit merely gives everything to God, Who has already given and received all that is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The untrue He has neither received nor given.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"245#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sin has no place in Heaven, where its results are alien and can no more enter than can their source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And therein lies your need to see your brother sinless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In him <i>is</i> Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>See sin in him instead, and Heaven is lost to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But see him as he is, and what is yours shines from him to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your savior gives you only love, but what you would receive of him is up to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It lies in him to overlook all your mistakes, and therein lies his own salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so it is with yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Salvation is a lesson in giving, as the Holy Spirit interprets it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is the reawakening of the laws of God in minds that have established other laws, and given them power to enforce what God created not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"245#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your insane laws were made to guarantee that you would make mistakes, and give them power over you by accepting their results as your just due.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What could this be but madness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And is it this that you would see within your savior from insanity?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He is as free from this as you are, and in the freedom that you see in him you see your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For this you share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What God has given follows His laws, and His alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor is it possible for those who follow them to suffer the results of any other source.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"245#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those who choose freedom will experience only its results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Their power is of God, and they will give it only to what God has given, to share with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing but this can touch them, for they see only this, sharing their power according to the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thus their freedom is established and maintained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is upheld through all temptation to imprison and to be imprisoned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is of them who learned of freedom that you should ask what freedom is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars, for those with little wings have not accepted for themselves the power to share with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"245#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The sinless give as they received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>See, then, the power of sinlessness within your brother, and share with him the power of the release from sin you offered him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To each who walks this earth in seeming solitude is a savior given, whose special function here is to release him, and so to free himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the world of separation each is appointed separately, though they are all the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet those who know that they are all the same need not salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And each one finds his savior when he is ready to look upon the face of Christ, and see Him sinless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"245#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The plan is not of you, nor need you be concerned with anything except the part that has been given you to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For He Who knows the rest will see to it without your help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But think not that He does not need your part to help Him with the rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For in your part lies all of it, without which is no part complete, nor is the whole completed without your part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ark of peace is entered two by two, yet the beginning of another world goes with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Each holy relationship must enter here, to learn its special function in the Holy Spirit’s plan, now that it shares His purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And as this purpose is fulfilled, a new world rises in which sin can enter not, and where the Son of God can enter without fear and where he rests a while, to forget imprisonment and to remember freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How can he enter, to rest and to remember, without you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Except you be there, he is not complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And it is his completion that he remembers there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"245#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the purpose given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Think not that your forgiveness of your brother serves but you two alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the whole new world rests in the hands of every two who enter here to rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And as they rest, the face of Christ shines on them and they remember the laws of God, forgetting all the rest and yearning only to have His laws perfectly fulfilled in them and all their brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Think you when this has been achieved that you will rest without them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You could no more leave one of them outside than I could leave you, and forget part of myself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"245#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may wonder how you can be at peace when, while you are in time, there is so much that must be done before the way to peace is open.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps this seems impossible to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But ask yourself if it is possible that God would have a plan for your salvation that does not work.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Once you accept His plan as the one function that you would fulfill, there will be nothing else the Holy Spirit will not arrange for you without your effort.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He will go before you making straight your path, and leaving in your way no stones to trip on, and no obstacles to bar your way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing you need will be denied you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Not one seeming difficulty but will melt away before you reach it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You need take thought for nothing, careless of everything except the only purpose that you would fulfill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>As that was given you, so will its fulfillment be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God’s guarantee will hold against all obstacles, for it rests on certainty and not contingency.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It rests on <i>you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"245#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And what can be more certain than a Son of God?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Nothing can hurt you unless you give it the power to do so.
