data-sentence-id=\"221#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who have spent your life in bringing truth to illusion, reality to fantasy, have walked the way of dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you have gone from waking to sleeping, and on and on to a yet deeper sleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each dream has led to other dreams, and every fantasy that seemed to bring a light into the darkness but made the darkness deeper.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your goal was darkness, in which no ray of light could enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you sought a blackness so complete that you could hide from truth forever, in complete insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What you forgot was simply that God cannot destroy Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The light is <i>in</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Darkness can cover it, but cannot put it out.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"221#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As the light comes nearer you will rush to darkness, shrinking from the truth, sometimes retreating to the lesser forms of fear, and sometimes to stark terror.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But you will advance, because your goal is the advance from fear to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The goal you accepted is the goal of knowledge, for which you signified your willingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fear seems to live in darkness, and when you are afraid you have stepped back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let us then join quickly in an instant of light, and it will be enough to remind you that your goal is light.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"221#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth has rushed to meet you since you called upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you knew Who walks beside you on the way that you have chosen, fear would be impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not know because the journey into darkness has been long and cruel, and you have gone deep into it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A little flicker of your eyelids, closed so long, has not yet been sufficient to give you confidence in yourself, so long despised.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You go toward love still hating it, and terribly afraid of its judgment upon you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you do not realize that you are not afraid of love, but only of what you have made of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are advancing to love’s meaning, and away from all illusions in which you have surrounded it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>When you retreat to the illusion your fear increases, for there is little doubt that what you think it means <i>is</i> fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet what is that to us who travel surely and very swiftly away from fear?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"221#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who hold your brother’s hand also hold mine, for when you joined each other you were not alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do you believe that I would leave you in the darkness that you agreed to leave with me?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In your relationship is this world’s light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And fear must disappear before you now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be tempted not to snatch away the gift of faith you offered to your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will succeed only in frightening yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The gift is given forever, for God Himself received it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You cannot take it back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You have accepted God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The holiness of your relationship is established in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You do not understand what you accepted, but remember that your understanding is not necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>All that was necessary was merely the <i>wish</i> to understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>That wish was the desire to be holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>The Will of God is granted you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#4:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>For you desire the only thing you ever had, or ever were.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"221#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Each instant that we spend together will teach you that this goal is possible, and will strengthen your desire to reach it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And in your desire lies its accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your desire is now in complete accord with all the power of the Holy Spirit’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No little, faltering footsteps that you may take can separate your desire from His Will and from His strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I hold your hand as surely as you agreed to take your brother’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will not separate, for I stand with you and walk with you in your advance to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And where we go we carry God with us.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"221#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In your relationship you have joined with me in bringing Heaven to the Son of God, who hid in darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have been willing to bring the darkness to light, and this willingness has given strength to everyone who would remain in darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Those who would see <i>will</i> see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And they will join with me in carrying their light into the darkness, when the darkness in them is offered to the light, and is removed forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>My need for you, joined with me in the holy light of your relationship, is your need for salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Would I not give you what you gave to me?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For when you joined your brother, you answered me.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"221#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who are now the bringer of salvation have the function of bringing light to darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The darkness in you has been brought to light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Carry it back to darkness, from the holy instant to which you brought it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We are made whole in our desire to make whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let not time worry you, for all the fear that you and your brother experience is really past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Time has been readjusted to help us do, together, what your separate pasts would hinder.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have gone past fear, for no two minds can join in the desire for love without love’s joining them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"221#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Not one light in Heaven but goes with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Not one Ray that shines forever in the Mind of God but shines on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Heaven is joined with you in your advance to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When such great lights have joined with you to give the little spark of your desire the power of God Himself, can you remain in darkness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You and your brother are coming home together, after a long and meaningless journey that you undertook apart, and that led nowhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have found your brother, and you will light each other’s way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"221#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And from this light will the Great Rays extend back into darkness and forward unto God, to shine away the past and so make room for His eternal Presence, in which everything is radiant in the light.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You who have spent your life
