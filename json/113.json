data-sentence-id=\"113#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you deny a blessing to a brother <i>you</i> will feel deprived, because denial is as total as love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is as impossible to deny part of the Sonship as it is to love it in part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor is it possible to love it totally at times.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot be totally committed sometimes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Denial has no power in itself, but you can give it the power of your mind, whose power is without limit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you use it to deny reality, reality is gone for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span><i>Reality cannot be partly appreciated.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>That is why denying any part of it means you have lost the awareness of all of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet denial is a defense, and so it is as capable of being used positively as well as negatively.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Used negatively it will be destructive, because it will be used for attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>But in the service of the Holy Spirit, it can help you recognize part of reality, and thus appreciate all of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Mind is too powerful to be subject to exclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#1:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>You will never be able to exclude yourself from your thoughts.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"113#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When a brother acts insanely, he is offering you an opportunity to bless him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His need is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You need the blessing you can offer him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no way for you to have it except by giving it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the law of God, and it has no exceptions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What you deny you lack, not because it is lacking, but because you have denied it in another and are therefore not aware of it in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Every response you make is determined by what you think you are, and what you want to be <i>is</i> what you think you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What you want to be, then, must determine every response you make.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"113#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not need God’s blessing because that you have forever, but you do need yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego’s picture of you is deprived, unloving and vulnerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot love this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you can very easily escape from this image by leaving it behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are not there and that is not you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not see this picture in anyone, or you have accepted it <i>as</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All illusions about the Sonship are dispelled together as they were made together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Teach no one that he is what you would not want to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your brother is the mirror in which you see the image of yourself as long as perception lasts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And perception will last until the Sonship knows itself as whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You made perception and it must last as long as you want it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"113#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span

them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Values are relative, but they are powerful because they are mental judgments.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The only way to dispel illusions is to withdraw all investment from them, and they will have no life for you because you will have put them out of your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>While you include them in it, you are giving life to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#4:6\"><span

are unaware of your gift because you do not give it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot make nothing live, since nothing cannot be enlivened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore, you are not extending the gift you both <i>have</i> and <i>are,</i> and so you do not know your being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All confusion comes from not extending life, because that is not the Will of your Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can do nothing apart from Him, and you <i>do</i> do nothing apart from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Keep His way to remember yourself, and teach His way lest you forget yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Give only honor to the Sons of the living God, and count yourself among them gladly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"113#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only honor is a fitting gift for those whom God Himself created worthy of honor, and whom He honors.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Give them the appreciation God accords them always, because they are His beloved Sons in whom He is well pleased.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot be apart from them because you are not apart from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Rest in His Love and protect your rest by loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But love everything He created, of which you are a part, or you cannot learn of His peace and accept His gift for yourself and as yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot know your own perfection until you have honored all those who were created like you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"113#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

always teaches you the inestimable worth of every Son of God, teaching it with infinite patience born of the infinite Love for which He speaks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Every attack is a call for His patience, since His patience can translate attack into blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Those who attack do not know they are blessed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They attack because they believe they are deprived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Give, therefore, of your abundance, and teach your brothers theirs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not share their illusions of scarcity, or you will perceive yourself as lacking.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"113#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Attack could never promote attack unless you perceived it as a means of depriving you of something you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you cannot lose anything unless you do not value it, and therefore do not want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This makes you feel deprived of it, and by projecting your own rejection you then believe that others are taking it from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You must be fearful if you believe that your brother is attacking you to tear the Kingdom of Heaven from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#8:5\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"113#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Being the part of your mind that does not believe it is responsible for itself, and being without allegiance to God, the ego is incapable of trust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Projecting its insane belief that you have been treacherous to your Creator, it believes that your brothers, who are as incapable of this as you are, are out to take God from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whenever a brother attacks another, that <i>is</i> what he believes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Projection always sees your wishes in others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If

else as your will, or you are denying what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Deny this and you will attack, believing you have been attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But see the Love of God in you, and you will see it everywhere because it <i>is</i> everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>See His abundance in everyone, and you will know that you are in Him with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#10:6\"><span

is lonely when His Sons do not know Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The peace of God is understanding this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"113#10:9\"><span
