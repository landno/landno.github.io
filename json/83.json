class=\"acim-text chap-4-sect-4\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you cannot hear the Voice for God, it is because you do not choose to listen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That you <i>do</i> listen to the voice of your ego is demonstrated by your attitudes, your feelings and your behavior.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet this is what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is what you are fighting to keep, and what you are vigilant to save.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your mind is filled with schemes to save the face of your ego, and you do not seek the face of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The glass in which the ego seeks to see its face is dark indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How can it maintain the trick of its existence except with mirrors?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But where you look to find yourself is up to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have said that you cannot change your mind by changing your behavior, but I have also said, and many times, that you <i>can</i> change your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When your mood tells you that you have chosen wrongly, and this is so whenever you are not joyous, then <i>know this need not be.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In every case you have thought wrongly about some brother God created, and are perceiving images your ego makes in a darkened glass.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think honestly what you have thought that God would not have thought, and what you have not thought that God would have you think.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Search sincerely for what you have done and left undone accordingly, and then change your mind to think with God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This may seem hard to do, but it is much easier than trying to think against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your mind is one with God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Denying this and thinking otherwise has held your ego together, but has literally split your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>As a loving brother I am deeply concerned with your mind, and urge you to follow my example as you look at yourself and at your brother, and see in both the glorious creations of a glorious Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you are sad, <i>know this need not be.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Depression comes from a sense of being deprived of something you want and do not have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember that you are deprived of nothing except by your own decisions, and then decide otherwise.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you are anxious, realize that anxiety comes from the capriciousness of the ego, and <i>know this need not be.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can be as vigilant against the ego’s dictates as for them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you feel guilty, remember that the ego has indeed violated the laws of God, but <i>you</i> have not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Leave the “sins” of the ego to me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is what Atonement is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But until you change your mind about those whom your ego has hurt, the Atonement cannot release you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>While you feel guilty your ego is in command, because only the ego can experience guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span><i>This need not be.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Watch your mind for the temptations of the ego, and do not be deceived by it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It offers you nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you have given up this voluntary dis-spiriting, you will see how your mind can focus and rise above fatigue and heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you are not sufficiently vigilant against the demands of the ego to disengage yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span><i>This need not be.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The habit of engaging with God and His creations is easily made if you actively refuse to let your mind slip away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The problem is not one of concentration; it is the belief that no one, including yourself, is worth consistent effort.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Side with me consistently against this deception, and do not permit this shabby belief to pull you back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The disheartened are useless to themselves and to me, but only the ego can <i>be</i> disheartened.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Have you really considered how many opportunities you have had to gladden yourself, and how many of them you have refused?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no limit to the power of a Son of God, but he can limit the expression of his power as much as he chooses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your mind and mine can unite in shining your ego away, releasing the strength of God into everything you think and do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not settle for anything less than this, and refuse to accept anything but this as your goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Watch your mind carefully for any beliefs that hinder its accomplishment, and step away from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Judge how well you have done this by your own feelings, for this is the one right use of judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Judgment, like any other defense, can be used to attack or protect; to hurt or to heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego <i>should</i> be brought to judgment and found wanting there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Without your own allegiance, protection and love, the ego cannot exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Let it be judged truly and you must withdraw allegiance, protection and love from it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are a mirror of truth, in which God Himself shines in perfect light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To the ego’s dark glass you need but say, “I will not look there because I know these images are not true.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then let the Holy One shine on you in peace, knowing that this and only this must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His Mind shone on you in your creation and brought your mind into being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His Mind still shines on you and must shine through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your ego cannot prevent Him from shining on you, but it can prevent you from letting Him shine through you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The First Coming of Christ is merely another name for the creation, for Christ is the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Second Coming of Christ means nothing more than the end of the ego’s rule and the healing of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I was created like you in the First, and I have called you to join with me in the Second.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am in charge of the Second Coming, and my judgment, which is used only for protection, cannot be wrong because it never attacks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yours may be so distorted that you believe I was mistaken in choosing you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I assure you this is a mistake of your ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not mistake it for humility.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your ego is trying to convince you that it is real and I am not, because if I am real, I am no more real than you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That knowledge, and I assure you that it <i>is</i> knowledge, means that Christ has come into your mind and healed it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"083#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I do not attack your ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I do work with your higher mind, the home of the Holy Spirit, whether you are asleep or awake, just as your ego does with your lower mind, which is its home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I am your vigilance in this, because you are too confused to recognize your own hope.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am not mistaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your mind will elect to join with mine, and together we are invincible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You and your brother will yet come together in my name, and your sanity will be restored.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I raised the dead by knowing that life is an eternal attribute of everything that the living God created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Why do you believe it is harder for me to inspire the dis-spirited or to stabilize the unstable?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I do not believe that there is an order of difficulty in miracles; you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I have called and you will answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>I understand that miracles are natural, because they are expressions of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"083#11:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>My calling you is as natural as your answer, and as inevitable.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"If you cannot
