class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have been told not to make error real, and the way to do this is very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you want to believe in error, you would have to make it real because it is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But truth is real in its own right, and to believe in truth <i>you do not have to do anything</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Understand that you do not respond to anything directly, but to your interpretation of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your interpretation thus becomes the justification for the response.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is why analyzing the motives of others is hazardous to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you decide that someone is really trying to attack you or desert you or enslave you, you will respond as if he had actually done so, having made his error real to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To interpret error is to give it power, and having done this you will overlook truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"155#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The analysis of ego motivation is very complicated, very obscuring, and never without your own ego involvement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The whole process represents a clear-cut attempt to demonstrate your own ability to understand what you perceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is shown by the fact that you react to your interpretations as if they were correct.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You may then control your reactions behaviorally, but not emotionally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This would obviously be a split or an attack on the integrity of your mind, pitting one level within it against another.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"155#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is but one interpretation of motivation that makes any sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And because it is the Holy Spirit’s judgment it requires no effort at all on your part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every loving thought is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everything else is an appeal for healing and help, regardless of the form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can anyone be justified in responding with anger to a brother’s plea for help?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No response can be appropriate except the willingness to give it to him, for this and only this is what he is asking for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Offer him anything else, and you are assuming the right to attack his reality by interpreting it as you see fit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Perhaps the danger of this to your own mind is not yet fully apparent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If you believe that an appeal for help is something else you will react to something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Your response will therefore be inappropriate to reality as it is, but not to your perception of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"155#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is nothing to prevent you from recognizing all calls for help as exactly what they are except your own imagined need to attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is only this that makes you willing to engage in endless “battles” with reality, in which you deny the reality of the need for healing by making it unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You would not do this except for your unwillingness to accept reality as it is, and which you therefore withhold from yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"155#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is surely good advice to tell you not to judge what you do not understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one with a personal investment is a reliable witness, for truth to him has become what he wants it to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you are unwilling to perceive an appeal for help as what it is, it is because you are unwilling to give help and to receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To fail to recognize a call for help is to refuse help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would you maintain that you do not need it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet this is what you are maintaining when you refuse to recognize a brother’s appeal, for only by answering his appeal <i>can</i> you be helped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Deny him your help and you will not recognize God’s Answer to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Holy Spirit does not need your help in interpreting motivation, but you do need His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"155#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only appreciation is an appropriate response to your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Gratitude is due him for both his loving thoughts and his appeals for help, for both are capable of bringing love into your awareness if you perceive them truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And all your sense of strain comes from your attempts not to do just this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How simple, then, is God’s plan for salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is but one response to reality, for reality evokes no conflict at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is but one Teacher of reality, Who understands what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He does not change His Mind about reality because reality does not change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Although your interpretations of reality are meaningless in your divided state, His remain consistently true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He gives them to you because they are <i>for</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Do not attempt to “help” a brother in your way, for you cannot help yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>But hear his call for the Help of God, and you will recognize your own need for the Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"155#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your interpretations of your brother’s needs are your interpretation of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>By giving help you are asking for it, and if you perceive but one need in yourself you will be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For you will recognize God’s Answer as you want It to be, and if you want It in truth, It will be truly yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Every appeal you answer in the Name of Christ brings the remembrance of your Father closer to your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the sake of your need, then, hear every call for help as what it is, so God can answer <i>you.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"155#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>By applying the Holy Spirit’s interpretation of the reactions of others more and more consistently, you will gain an increasing awareness that His criteria are equally applicable to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For to recognize fear is not enough to escape from it, although the recognition is necessary to demonstrate the need for escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit must still translate the fear into truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you were left with the fear, once you had recognized it, you would have taken a step away from reality, not towards it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet we have repeatedly emphasized the need to recognize fear and face it without disguise as a crucial step in the undoing of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Consider how well the Holy Spirit’s interpretation of the motives of others will serve you then.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Having taught you to accept only loving thoughts in others and to regard everything else as an appeal for help, He has taught you that fear itself is an appeal for help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is what recognizing fear really means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If you do not protect it, He will reinterpret it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>That is the ultimate value in learning to perceive attack as a call for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>We have already learned that fear and attack are inevitably associated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>If only attack produces fear, and if you see attack as the call for help that it is, the unreality of fear must dawn on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>For fear <i>is</i> a call for love, in unconscious recognition of what has been denied.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"155#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Fear is a symptom of your own deep sense of loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If when you perceive it in others you learn to supply the loss, the basic cause of fear is removed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thereby you teach yourself that fear does not exist in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The means for removing it is in yourself, and you have demonstrated this by giving it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Fear and love are the only emotions of which you are capable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>One is false, for it was made out of denial; and denial depends on the belief in what is denied for its own existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>By interpreting fear correctly as a positive affirmation of the underlying belief it masks, you are undermining its perceived usefulness by rendering it useless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Defenses that do not work at all are automatically discarded.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If you raise what fear conceals to clear-cut unequivocal predominance, fear becomes meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You have denied its power to conceal love, which was its only purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The veil that you have drawn across the face of love has disappeared.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"155#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you would look upon love, which <i>is</i> the world’s reality, how could you do better than to recognize, in every defense against it, the underlying appeal <i>for</i> it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And how could you better learn of its reality than by answering the appeal for it by giving it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit’s interpretation of fear does dispel it, for the awareness of truth cannot be denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus does the Holy Spirit replace fear with love and translate error into truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus will you learn of Him how to replace your dream of separation with the fact of unity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"155#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the separation is only the denial of union, and correctly interpreted, attests to your eternal knowledge that union is true.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You have been told not to make error real, and the way to do this is very simple.
