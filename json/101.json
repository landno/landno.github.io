class=\"acim-text chap-6-sect-4\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember that the Holy Spirit is the Answer, not the question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego always speaks first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is capricious and does not mean its maker well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It believes, and correctly, that its maker may withdraw his support from it at any moment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If it meant you well it would be glad, as the Holy Spirit will be glad when He has brought you home and you no longer need His guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego does not regard itself as part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Herein lies its primary error, the foundation of its whole thought system.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When God created you He made you part of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is why attack within the Kingdom is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You made the ego without love, and so it does not love you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You could not remain within the Kingdom without love, and since the Kingdom <i>is</i> love, you believe that you are without it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This enables the ego to regard itself as separate and outside its maker, thus speaking for the part of your mind that believes <i>you</i> are separate and outside the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego, then, raised the first question that was ever asked, but one it can never answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That question, “What are you?” was the beginning of doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego has never answered any questions since, although it has raised a great many.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The most inventive activities of the ego have never done more than obscure the question, because you have the answer and <i>the ego is afraid of you.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot understand the conflict until you fully understand the basic fact that the ego cannot know anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit does not speak first, <i>but He always answers.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Everyone has called upon Him for help at one time or another and in one way or another, and has been answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Since the Holy Spirit answers truly He answers for all time, which means that everyone has the answer <i>now.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego cannot hear the Holy Spirit, but it does believe that part of the mind that made it is against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It interprets this as a justification for attacking its maker.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It believes that the best defense is attack, and wants <i>you</i> to believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Unless you do believe it you will not side with it, and the ego feels badly in need of allies, though not of brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perceiving something alien to itself in your mind, the ego turns to the body as its ally, because the body is <i>not</i> part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This makes the body the ego’s friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is an alliance frankly based on separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you side with this alliance you will be afraid, because you are siding with an alliance of fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego uses the body to conspire against your mind, and because the ego realizes that its “enemy” can end them both merely by recognizing they are not part of you, they join in the attack together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is perhaps the strangest perception of all, if you consider what it really involves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego, which is not real, attempts to persuade the mind, which <i>is</i> real, that the mind is the ego’s learning device; and further, that the body is more real than the mind is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one in his right mind could possibly believe this, and no one in his right mind does believe it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Hear, then, the one answer of the Holy Spirit to all the questions the ego raises: You are a child of God, a priceless part of His Kingdom, which He created as part of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothing else exists and only this is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have chosen a sleep in which you have had bad dreams, but the sleep is not real and God calls you to awake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There will be nothing left of your dream when you hear Him, because you will awaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your dreams contain many of the ego’s symbols and they have confused you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet that was only because you were asleep and did not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When you wake you will see the truth around you and in you, and you will no longer believe in dreams because they will have no reality for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet the Kingdom and all that you have created there will have great reality for you, because they are beautiful and true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the Kingdom, where you are and what you are is perfectly certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no doubt, because the first question was never asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Having finally been wholly answered, <i>it has never been</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span><i>Being</i> alone lives in the Kingdom, where everything lives in God without question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The time spent on questioning in the dream has given way to creation and to its eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are as certain as God because you are as true as He is, but what was once certain in your mind has become only the ability for certainty.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The introduction of abilities into being was the beginning of uncertainty, because abilities are potentials, not accomplishments.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your abilities are useless in the presence of God’s accomplishments, and also of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Accomplishments are results that have been achieved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When they are perfect, abilities are meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is curious that the perfect must now be perfected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In fact, it is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Remember, however, that when you put yourself in an impossible situation you believe that the impossible <i>is</i> possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Abilities must be developed before you can use them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not true of anything that God created, but it is the kindest solution possible for what you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In an impossible situation, you can develop your abilities to the point where they can get you out of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have a Guide to how to develop them, but you have no commander except yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This leaves you in charge of the Kingdom, with both a Guide to find it and a means to keep it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have a model to follow who will strengthen your command, and never detract from it in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You therefore retain the central place in your imagined enslavement, which in itself demonstrates that you are not enslaved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are in an impossible situation only because you think it is possible to be in one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You <i>would</i> be in an impossible situation if God showed you your perfection, and proved to you that you were wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This would demonstrate that the perfect are inadequate to bring themselves to the awareness of their perfection, and thus side with the belief that those who have everything need help and are therefore helpless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the kind of “reasoning” in which the ego engages.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God, Who knows that His creations are perfect, does not affront them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This would be as impossible as the ego’s notion that it has affronted Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That is why the Holy Spirit never commands.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To command is to assume inequality, which the Holy Spirit demonstrates does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fidelity to premises is a law of mind, and everything God created is faithful to His laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fidelity to other laws is also possible, however, not because the laws are true, but because you made them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What would be gained if God proved to you that you have thought insanely?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can God lose His Own certainty?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I have frequently said that what you teach you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Would you have God teach you that you have sinned?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If He confronted the self you made with the truth He created for you, what could you be but afraid?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You would doubt your right mind, which is the only place where you can find the sanity He gave you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"101#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God does not teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To teach is to imply a lack, which God knows is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God is not conflicted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Teaching aims at change, but God created only the changeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The separation was not a loss of perfection, but a failure in communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A harsh and strident form of communication arose as the ego’s voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It could not shatter the peace of God, but it could shatter <i>yours.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God did not blot it out, because to eradicate it would be to attack it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Being questioned, He did not question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He merely gave the Answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"101#12:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>His Answer is your Teacher.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Remember that the Holy Spirit is the Answer, not the question.
