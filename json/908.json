Illness","inlineNumber":"IV."},"annotation":"P-2.IV","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text psycho-2-sect-4\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As all therapy is psychotherapy, so all illness is mental illness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a judgment on the Son of God, and judgment is a mental activity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Judgment is a decision, made again and again, against creation and its Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a decision to perceive the universe as you would have created it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is a decision that truth can lie and must be lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What, then, can illness be except an expression of sorrow and of guilt?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And who could weep but for his innocence?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Once God’s Son is seen as guilty, illness becomes inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has been asked for and will be received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And all who ask for illness have now condemned themselves to seek for remedies that cannot help, because their faith is in the illness and not in salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There can be nothing that a change of mind cannot effect, for all external things are only shadows of a decision already made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Change the decision, and how can its shadow be unchanged?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Illness can be but guilt’s shadow, grotesque and ugly since it mimics deformity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If a deformity is seen as real, what could its shadow be except deformed?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The descent into hell follows step by step in an inevitable course, once the decision that guilt is real has been made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Sickness and death and misery now stalk the earth in unrelenting waves, sometimes together and sometimes in grim succession.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet all these things, however real they seem, are but illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who could have faith in them once this is realized?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And who could not have faith in them until he realizes this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Healing is therapy or correction, and we have said already and will say again, all therapy is psychotherapy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To heal the sick is but to bring this realization to them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The word “cure” has come into disrepute among the more “respectable” therapists of the world, and justly so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For not one of them can cure, and not one of them understands healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>At worst, they but make the body real in their own minds, and having done so, seek for magic by which to heal the ills with which their minds endow it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How could such a process cure?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is ridiculous from start to finish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet having started, it must finish thus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is as if God were the devil and must be found in evil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How could love be there?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And how could sickness cure?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Are not these both one question?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>At best, and the word is perhaps questionable here, the “healers” of the world may recognize the mind as the source of illness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But their error lies in the belief that it can cure itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This has some merit in a world where “degrees of error” is a meaningful concept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet must their cures remain temporary, or another illness rise instead, for death has not been overcome until the meaning of love is understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And who can understand this without the Word of God, given by Him to the Holy Spirit as His gift to you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Illness of any kind may be defined as the result of a view of the self as weak, vulnerable, evil and endangered, and thus in need of constant defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet if such were really the self, defense would be impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, the defenses sought for must be magical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They must overcome all limits perceived in the self, at the same time making a new self-concept into which the old one cannot return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In a word, error is accepted as real and dealt with by illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Truth being brought to illusions, reality now becomes a threat and is perceived as evil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Love becomes feared because reality is love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Thus is the circle closed against the “inroads” of salvation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Illness is therefore a mistake and needs correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And as we have already emphasized, correction cannot be achieved by first establishing the “rightness” of the mistake and then overlooking it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If illness is real it cannot be overlooked in truth, for to overlook reality is insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet that is magic’s purpose; to make illusions true through false perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This cannot heal, for it opposes truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perhaps an illusion of health is substituted for a little while, but not for long.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Fear cannot long be hidden by illusions, for it is part of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It will escape and take another form, being the source of all illusions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness is insanity because all sickness is mental illness, and in it there are no degrees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>One of the illusions by which sickness is perceived as real is the belief that illness varies in intensity; that the degree of threat differs according to the form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Herein lies the basis of all errors, for all of them are but attempts to compromise by seeing just a little bit of hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is a mockery so alien to God that it must be forever inconceivable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But the insane believe it because they are insane.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A madman will defend his own illusions because in them he sees his own salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Thus, he will attack the one who tries to save him from them, believing that he is attacking him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This curious circle of attack-defense is one of the most difficult problems with which the psychotherapist must deal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In fact, this is his central task; the core of psychotherapy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The therapist is seen as one who is attacking the patient’s most cherished possession; his picture of himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And since this picture has become the patient’s security as he perceives it, the therapist cannot but be seen as a real source of danger, to be attacked and even killed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The psychotherapist, then, has a tremendous responsibility.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He must meet attack without attack, and therefore without defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is his task to demonstrate that defenses are not necessary, and that defenselessness is strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This must be his teaching, if his lesson is to be that sanity is safe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the insane believe that sanity is threat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the corollary of the “original sin”; the belief that guilt is real and fully justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is therefore the psychotherapist’s function to teach that guilt, being unreal, cannot be justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But neither is it safe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And thus it must remain unwanted as well as unreal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"908#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation’s single doctrine is the goal of all therapy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Relieve the mind of the insane burden of guilt it carries so wearily, and healing is accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body is not cured.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is merely recognized as what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Seen rightly, its purpose can be understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What is the need for sickness then?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Given this single shift, all else will follow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There is no need for complicated change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There is no need for long analyses and wearying discussion and pursuits.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"908#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The truth is simple, being one for all.</span></p></div>
