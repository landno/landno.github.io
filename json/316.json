data-sentence-id=\"316#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Without a cause there can be no effects, and yet without effects there is no cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The cause a cause is <i>made</i> by its effects; the Father <i>is</i> a Father by His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Effects do not create their cause, but they establish its causation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus, the Son gives Fatherhood to his Creator, and receives the gift that he has given Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is <i>because</i> he is God’s Son that he must also be a father, who creates as God created him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The circle of creation has no end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Its starting and its ending are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But in itself it holds the universe of all creation, without beginning and without an end.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Fatherhood <i>is</i> creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love must be extended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Purity is not confined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the nature of the innocent to be forever uncontained, without a barrier or limitation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus is purity not of the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nor can it be found where limitation is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The body can be healed by its effects, which are as limitless as is itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet must all healing come about because the mind is recognized as not within the body, and its innocence is quite apart from it, and where all healing is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Where, then, is healing?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Only where its cause is given its effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>For sickness is a meaningless attempt to give effects to causelessness, and make it be a cause.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Always in sickness does the Son of God attempt to make himself his cause, and not allow himself to be his Father’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this impossible desire, he does not believe that he is Love’s Effect, and must be cause because of what he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The cause of healing is the only Cause of everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It has but <i>one</i> Effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And in that recognition, causelessness is given no effects and none is seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A mind within a body and a world of other bodies, each with separate minds, are your “creations,” you the “other” mind, creating with effects unlike yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And as their “father,” you must be like them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing at all has happened but that you have put yourself to sleep, and dreamed a dream in which you were an alien to yourself, and but a part of someone else’s dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The miracle does not awaken you, but merely shows you who the dreamer is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It teaches you there is a choice of dreams while you are still asleep, depending on the purpose of your dreaming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do you wish for dreams of healing, or for dreams of death?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A dream is like a memory in that it pictures what you wanted shown to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>An empty storehouse, with an open door, holds all your shreds of memories and dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet if you are the dreamer, you perceive this much at least: that you have caused the dream, and can accept another dream as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But for this change in content of the dream, it must be realized that it is you who dreamed the dreaming that you do not like.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is but an effect that <i>you</i> have caused, and you would not be cause of this effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In dreams of murder and attack are you the victim in a dying body slain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But in forgiving dreams is no one asked to be the victim and the sufferer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>These are the happy dreams the miracle exchanges for your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It does not ask you make another; only that you see you made the one you would exchange for this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This world is causeless, as is every dream that anyone has dreamed within the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No plans are possible, and no design exists that could be found and understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What else could be expected from a thing that has no cause?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet if it has no cause, it has no purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You may cause a dream, but never will you give it real effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For that would change its cause, and it is this you cannot do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The dreamer of a dream is not awake, but does not know he sleeps.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He sees illusions of himself as sick or well, depressed or happy, but without a stable cause with guaranteed effects.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle establishes you dream a dream, and that its content is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is a crucial step in dealing with illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one is afraid of them when he perceives he made them up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The fear was held in place because he did not see that he was author of the dream, and not a figure in the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He gives himself the consequences that he dreams he gave his brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And it is but this the dream has put together and has offered him, to show him that his wishes have been done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Thus does he fear his own attack, but sees it at another’s hands.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>As victim, he is suffering from its effects, but not their cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He authored not his own attack, and he is innocent of what he caused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The miracle does nothing but to show him that he has done nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>What he fears is cause without the consequences that would make it cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And so it never was.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The separation started with the dream the Father was deprived of His Effects, and powerless to keep them since He was no longer their Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the dream, the dreamer made himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But what he made has turned against him, taking on the role of its creator, as the dreamer had.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And as he hated his Creator, so the figures in the dream have hated him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His body is their slave, which they abuse because the motives he has given it have they adopted as their own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And hate it for the vengeance it would offer them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is their vengeance on the body which appears to prove the dreamer could not be the maker of the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Effect and cause are first split off, and then reversed, so that effect becomes a cause; the cause, effect.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the separation’s final step, with which salvation, which proceeds to go the other way, begins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This final step is an effect of what has gone before, appearing as a cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The miracle is the first step in giving back to cause the function of causation, not effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For this confusion has produced the dream, and while it lasts will wakening be feared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor will the call to wakening be heard, because it seems to be the call to fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Like every lesson that the Holy Spirit requests you learn, the miracle is clear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It demonstrates what He would have you learn, and shows you its effects are what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In His forgiving dreams are the effects of yours undone, and hated enemies perceived as friends with merciful intent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Their enmity is seen as causeless now, because they did not make it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you can accept the role of maker of their hate, because you see that it has no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Now are you freed from this much of the dream; the world is neutral, and the bodies that still seem to move about as separate things need not be feared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so they are not sick.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle returns the cause of fear to you who made it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But it also shows that, having no effects, it is not cause, because the function of causation is to have effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And where effects are gone, there is no cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus is the body healed by miracles because they show the mind made sickness, and employed the body to be victim, or effect, of what it made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet half the lesson will not teach the whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The miracle is useless if you learn but that the body can be healed, for this is not the lesson it was sent to teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The lesson is the <i>mind</i> was sick that thought the body could be sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing, and had no effects.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"316#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This world is full of miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They stand in shining silence next to every dream of pain and suffering, of sin and guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are the dream’s alternative, the choice to be the dreamer, rather than deny the active role in making up the dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are the glad effects of taking back the consequence of sickness to its cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The body is released because the mind acknowledges “this is not done to me, but <i>I</i> am doing this.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And thus the mind is free to make another choice instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"316#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Beginning here, salvation will proceed to change the course of every step in the descent to separation, until all the steps have been retraced, the ladder gone, and all the dreaming of the world undone.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Without a cause there can be no effects, and yet without effects there is no cause.
