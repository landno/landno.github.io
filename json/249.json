<span data-sentence-id=\"249#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Vision will come to you at first in glimpses, but they will be enough to show you what is given you who see your brother sinless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Truth is restored to you through your desire, as it was lost to you through your desire for something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Open the holy place that you closed off by valuing the “something else,” and what was never lost will quietly return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It has been saved for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Vision would not be necessary had judgment not been made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Desire now its whole undoing, and it is done for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#2\"><p

data-sentence-id=\"249#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you not happily exchange your doubts for certainty?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you not willingly be free of misery, and learn again of joy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your holy relationship offers all this to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As it was given you, so will be its effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And as its holy purpose was not made by you, the means by which its happy end is yours is also not of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Rejoice in what is yours but for the asking, and think not that you need make either means or end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All this is given you who would but see your brother sinless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>All this is given, waiting on your desire but to receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Vision is freely given to those who ask to see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#3:1\"><span class=\"snr

class=\"snr\">2</span>For peace will come to all who ask for it with real desire and sincerity of purpose, shared with the Holy Spirit and at one with Him on what salvation is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Be willing, then, to see your brother sinless, that Christ may rise before your vision and give you joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And place no value on your brother’s body, which holds him to illusions of what he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is his desire to see his sinlessness, as it is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And bless the Son of God in your relationship, nor see in him what you have made of him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit guarantees that what God willed and gave you shall be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is your purpose now, and the vision that makes it yours is ready to be given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have the vision that enables you to see the body not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And as you look upon your brother, you will see an altar to your Father, holy as Heaven, glowing with radiant purity and sparkling with the shining lilies you laid upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What can you value more than this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Why do you think the body is a better home, a safer shelter for God’s Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Why would you rather look on it than on the truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How can the engine of destruction be preferred, and chosen to replace the holy home the Holy Spirit offers, where He will dwell with you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#5:1\"><span class=\"snr

data-sentence-id=\"249#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you turn in your distress and need for help unto the helpless?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is the pitifully little the perfect choice to call upon for strength?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Judgment will seem to make your savior weak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it is <i>you</i> who need his strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no problem, no event or situation, no perplexity that vision will not solve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All is redeemed when looked upon with vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For this is not <i>your</i> sight, and brings with it the laws beloved of Him Whose sight it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everything looked upon with vision falls gently into place, according to the laws brought to it by His calm and certain sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The end for everything He looks upon is always sure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it will meet His purpose, seen in unadjusted form and suited perfectly to meet it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Destructiveness becomes benign, and sin is turned to blessing under His gentle gaze.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What can the body’s eyes perceive, with power to correct?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Its eyes adjust to sin, unable to overlook it in any form and seeing it everywhere, in everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Look through its eyes, and everything will stand condemned before you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All that could save you, you will never see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your holy relationship, the source of your salvation, will be deprived of meaning, and its most holy purpose bereft of means for its accomplishment.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Judgment is but a toy, a whim, the senseless means to play the idle game of death in your imagination.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But vision sets all things right, bringing them gently within the kindly sway of Heaven’s laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What if you recognized this world is an hallucination?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What if you really understood you made it up?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What if you realized that those who seem to walk about in it, to sin and die, attack and murder and destroy themselves, are wholly unreal?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Could you have faith in what you see, if you accepted this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And would you see it?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Hallucinations disappear when they are recognized for what they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the healing and the remedy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Believe them not and they are gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And all you need to do is recognize that <i>you</i> did this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Once you accept this simple fact and take unto yourself the power you gave them, you are released from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>One thing is sure; hallucinations serve a purpose, and when that purpose is no longer held they disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Therefore, the question never is whether you want them, but always, do you want the purpose that they serve?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This world seems to hold out many purposes, each different and with different values.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet they are all the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Again there is no order; only a seeming hierarchy of values.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only two purposes are possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And one is sin, the other holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing is in between, and which you choose determines what you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For what you see is merely how you elect to meet your goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Hallucinations serve to meet the goal of madness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They are the means by which the outside world, projected from within, adjusts to sin and seems to witness to its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It still is true that nothing is without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet upon nothing are all projections made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For it is the projection that gives the “nothing” all the meaning that it holds.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What has no meaning cannot be perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And meaning always looks within to find itself, and <i>then</i> looks out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All meaning that you give the world outside must thus reflect the sight you saw within; or better, if you saw at all or merely judged against.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Vision is the means by which the Holy Spirit translates your nightmares into happy dreams; your wild hallucinations that show you all the fearful outcomes of imagined sin into the calm and reassuring sights with which He would replace them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>These gentle sights and sounds are looked on happily, and heard with joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They are His substitutes for all the terrifying sights and screaming sounds the ego’s purpose brought to your horrified awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They step away from sin, reminding you that it is not reality which frightens you, and that the errors which you made can be corrected.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"249#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have looked on what seemed terrifying, and seen it change to sights of loveliness and peace; when you have looked on scenes of violence and death, and watched them change to quiet views of gardens under open skies, with clear, life-giving water running happily beside them in dancing brooks that never waste away; who need persuade you to accept the gift of vision?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And after vision, who is there who could refuse what must come after?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think but an instant just on this; you can behold the holiness God gave His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"249#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And never need you think that there is something else for you to see.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Vision will come to you at first in glimpses, but they will be enough
