class=\"acim-text chap-13-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have said you have but two emotions, love and fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>One is changeless but continually exchanged, being offered by the eternal to the eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In this exchange it is extended, for it increases as it is given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The other has many forms, for the content of individual illusions differs greatly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet they have one thing in common; they are all insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They are made of sights that are not seen, and sounds that are not heard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They make up a private world that cannot be shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For they are meaningful only to their maker, and so they have no meaning at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>In this world their maker moves alone, for only he perceives them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Each one peoples his world with figures from his individual past, and it is because of this that private worlds do differ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the figures that he sees were never real, for they are made up only of his reactions to his brothers, and do not include their reactions to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, he does not see he made them, and that they are not whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For these figures have no witnesses, being perceived in one separate mind only.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is through these strange and shadowy figures that the insane relate to their insane world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For they see only those who remind them of these images, and it is to them that they relate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus do they communicate with those who are not there, and it is they who answer them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And no one hears their answer save him who called upon them, and he alone believes they answered him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Projection makes perception, and you cannot see beyond it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Again and again have you attacked your brother, because you saw in him a shadow figure in your private world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And thus it is you must attack yourself first, for what you attack is not in others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Its only reality is in your own mind, and by attacking others you are literally attacking what is not there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The delusional can be very destructive, for they do not recognize they have condemned themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They do not wish to die, yet they will not let condemnation go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so they separate into their private worlds, where everything is disordered, and where what is within appears to be without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet what is within they do not see, for the reality of their brothers they cannot recognize.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have but two emotions, yet in your private world you react to each of them as though it were the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For love cannot abide in a world apart, where when it comes it is not recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you see your own hatred as your brother, you are not seeing him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everyone draws nigh unto what he loves, and recoils from what he fears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you react with fear to love, and draw away from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet fear attracts you, and believing it is love, you call it to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your private world is filled with figures of fear you have invited into it, and all the love your brothers offer you, you do not see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As you look with open eyes upon your world, it must occur to you that you have withdrawn into insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You see what is not there, and you hear what makes no sound.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your manifestations of emotions are the opposite of what the emotions are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You communicate with no one, and you are as isolated from reality as if you were alone in all the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In your madness you overlook reality completely, and you see only your own split mind everywhere you look.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God calls you and you do not hear, for you are preoccupied with your own voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And the vision of Christ is not in your sight, for you look upon yourself alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Little child, would you offer this to your Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For if you offer it to yourself, you <i>are</i> offering it to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And He will not return it, for it is unworthy of you because it is unworthy of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet He would release you from it and set you free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His sane Answer tells you what you have offered yourself is not true, but His offering to you has never changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You who know not what you do can learn what insanity is, and look beyond it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is given you to learn how to deny insanity, and come forth from your private world in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You will see all that you denied in your brothers because you denied it in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For you will love them, and by drawing nigh unto them you will draw them to yourself, perceiving them as witnesses to the reality you share with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I am with them as I am with you, and we will draw them from their private worlds, for as we are united so would we unite with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The Father welcomes all of us in gladness, and gladness is what we should offer Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>For every Son of God is given you to whom God gave Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#7:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>And it is God Whom you must offer them, to recognize His gift to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Vision depends on light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot see in darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet in darkness, in the private world of sleep, you see in dreams although your eyes are closed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it is here that what you see you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But let the darkness go and all you made you will no longer see, for sight of it depends upon denying vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet from denying vision it does not follow you cannot see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But this is what denial does, for by it you accept insanity, believing you can make a private world and rule your own perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet for this, light must be excluded.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Dreams disappear when light has come and you can see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not seek vision through your eyes, for you made your way of seeing that you might see in darkness, and in this you are deceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Beyond this darkness, and yet still within you, is the vision of Christ, Who looks on all in light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your “vision” comes from fear, as His from love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And He sees for you, as your witness to the real world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is the Holy Spirit’s manifestation, looking always on the real world, and calling forth its witnesses and drawing them to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He loves what He sees within you, and He would extend it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And He will not return unto the Father until He has extended your perception even unto Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And there perception is no more, for He has returned you to the Father with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have but two emotions, and one you made and one was given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each is a way of seeing, and different worlds arise from their different sights.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>See through the vision that is given you, for through Christ’s vision He beholds Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And seeing what He is, He knows His Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Beyond your darkest dreams He sees God’s guiltless Son within you, shining in perfect radiance that is undimmed by your dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And this <i>you</i> will see as you look with Him, for His vision is His gift of love to you, given Him of the Father for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"169#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is the light in which Christ stands revealed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And all who would behold Him can see Him, for they have asked for light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor will they see Him alone, for He is no more alone than they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Because they saw the Son, they have risen in Him to the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And all this will they understand, because they looked within and saw beyond the darkness the Christ in them, and recognized Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In the sanity of His vision they looked upon themselves with love, seeing themselves as the Holy Spirit sees them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"169#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And with this vision of the truth in them came all the beauty of the world to shine upon them.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"I have said you have but two emotions, love and fear.
