data-sentence-id=\"153#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is a very simple course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you do not feel you need a course which, in the end, teaches that only reality is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But do you believe it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you perceive the real world, you will recognize that you did not believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the swiftness with which your new and only real perception will be translated into knowledge will leave you but an instant to realize that this alone is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And then everything you made will be forgotten; the good and the bad, the false and the true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For as Heaven and earth become one, even the real world will vanish from your sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The end of the world is not its destruction, but its translation into Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The reinterpretation of the world is the transfer of all perception to knowledge.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Bible tells you to become as little children.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Little children recognize that they do not understand what they perceive, and so they ask what it means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not make the mistake of believing that you understand what you perceive, for its meaning is lost to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the Holy Spirit has saved its meaning for you, and if you will let Him interpret it, He will restore to you what you have thrown away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet while you think you know its meaning, you will see no need to ask it of Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not know the meaning of anything you perceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Not one thought you hold is wholly true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The recognition of this is your firm beginning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are not misguided; you have accepted no guide at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Instruction in perception is your great need, for you understand nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Recognize this but do not accept it, for understanding is your inheritance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Perceptions are learned, and you are not without a Teacher.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet your willingness to learn of Him depends on your willingness to question everything you learned of yourself, for you who learned amiss should not be your own teacher.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can withhold truth except from himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet God will not refuse you the Answer He gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Ask, then, for what is yours, but which you did not make, and do not defend yourself against truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You made the problem God has answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Ask yourself, therefore, but one simple question:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"153#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do I want the problem or do I want the answer?</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"153#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Decide for the answer and you will have it, for you will see it as it is, and it is yours already.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may complain that this course is not sufficiently specific for you to understand and use.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet perhaps you have not done what it specifically advocates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is not a course in the play of ideas, but in their practical application.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing could be more specific than to be told that if you ask you will receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit will answer every specific problem as long as you believe that problems are specific.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His answer is both many and one, as long as you believe that the one is many.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You may be afraid of His specificity, for fear of what you think it will demand of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet only by asking will you learn that nothing of God demands anything of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>God gives; He does not take.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>When you refuse to ask, it is because you believe that asking is taking rather than sharing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit will give you only what is yours, and will take nothing in return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For what is yours is everything, and you share it with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Would the Holy Spirit, Who wills only to restore, be capable of misinterpreting the question you must ask to learn His answer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You <i>have</i> heard the answer, but you have misunderstood the question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You believe that to ask for guidance of the Holy Spirit is to ask for deprivation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Little child of God, you do not understand your Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You believe in a world that takes, because you believe that you can get by taking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And by that perception you have lost sight of the real world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are afraid of the world as you see it, but the real world is still yours for the asking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not deny it to yourself, for it can only free you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing of God will enslave His Son whom He created free and whose freedom is protected by His Being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Blessed are you who are willing to ask the truth of God without fear, for only thus can you learn that His answer is the release from fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#8:1\"><span class=\"snr

<span data-sentence-id=\"153#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Kingdom of Heaven <i>is</i> within you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Believe that the truth is in me, for I know that it is in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s Sons have nothing they do not share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ask for truth of any Son of God, and you have asked it of me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Not one of us but has the answer in him, to give to anyone who asks it of him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#9:1\"><span class=\"snr

data-sentence-id=\"153#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not, then, be deceived in your brother, and see only his loving thoughts as his reality, for by denying that his mind is split you will heal yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Accept him as his Father accepts him and heal him unto Christ, for Christ is his healing and yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Christ is the Son of God Who is in no way separate from His Father, Whose every thought is as loving as the Thought of His Father by which He was created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be not deceived in God’s Son, for thereby you must be deceived in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And being deceived in yourself you are deceived in your Father, in Whom no deceit is possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the real world there is no sickness, for there is no separation and no division.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only loving thoughts are recognized, and because no one is without your help, the Help of God goes with you everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As you become willing to accept this Help by asking for It, you will give It because you want It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing will be beyond your healing power, because nothing will be denied your simple request.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What problems will not disappear in the Presence of God’s Answer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ask, then, to learn of the reality of your brother, because this is what you will perceive in him, and you will see your beauty reflected in his.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not accept your brother’s variable perception of himself for his split mind is yours, and you will not accept your healing without his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you share the real world as you share Heaven, and his healing is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To love yourself is to heal yourself, and you cannot perceive part of you as sick and achieve your goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Brother, we heal together as we live together and love together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be not deceived in God’s Son, for he is one with himself and one with his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Love him who is beloved of his Father, and you will learn of the Father’s Love for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#12:1\"><span class=\"snr

you, you are offended in yourself and are condemning God’s Son whom God condemneth not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let the Holy Spirit remove all offenses of God’s Son against himself and perceive no one but through His guidance, for He would save you from all condemnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Accept His healing power and use it for all He sends you, for He wills to heal the Son of God, in whom He is not deceived.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"153#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet if they ask someone they trust for the meaning of what they perceive, and are willing to let their own interpretations go in favor of reality, their fear goes with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When a child is helped to translate his “ghost” into a curtain, his “monster” into a shadow, and his “dragon” into a dream he is no longer afraid, and laughs happily at his own fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span

you too will laugh at your fears and replace them with peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For fear lies not in reality, but in the minds of children who do not understand reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is only their lack of understanding that frightens them, and when they learn to perceive truly they are not afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And because of this they will ask for truth again when they are frightened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is not the reality of your brothers or your Father or yourself that frightens you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You do not know what they are, and so you perceive them as ghosts and monsters and dragons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#14:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Ask what their reality is from the One Who knows it, and He will tell you what they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#14:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For you do not understand them, and because you are deceived by what you see you need reality to dispel your fears.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"153#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span

class=\"snr\">2</span>For if God is not deceived in you, you can be deceived only in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you can learn the truth about yourself from the Holy Spirit, Who will teach you that, as part of God, deceit in you is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you perceive yourself without deceit, you will accept the real world in place of the false one you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"153#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And then your Father will lean down to you and take the last step for you, by raising you unto Himself.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"This is a very simple course.
