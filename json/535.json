data-sentence-id=\"535#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perception is consistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What you see reflects your thinking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And your thinking but reflects your choice of what you want to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your values are determiners of this, for what you value you must want to see, believing what you see is really there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one can see a world his mind has not accorded value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And no one can fail to look upon what he believes he wants.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet who can really hate and love at once?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who can desire what he does not want to have reality?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And who can choose to see a world of which he is afraid?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fear must make blind, for this its weapon is: That which you fear to see you cannot see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Love and perception thus go hand in hand, but fear obscures in darkness what is there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What, then, can fear project upon the world?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What can be seen in darkness that is real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Truth is eclipsed by fear, and what remains is but imagined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet what can be real in blind imaginings of panic born?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What would you want that this is shown to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What would you wish to keep in such a dream?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Fear has made everything you think you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All separation, all distinctions, and the multitude of differences you believe make up the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Love‚Äôs enemy has made them up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet love can have no enemy, and so they have no cause, no being and no consequence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They can be valued, but remain unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They can be sought, but they can not be found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Today we will not seek for them, nor waste this day in seeking what can not be found.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible to see two worlds which have no overlap of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Seek for the one; the other disappears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But one remains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are the range of choice beyond which your decision cannot go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The real and the unreal are all there are to choose between, and nothing more than these.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we will attempt no compromise where none is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world you see is proof you have already made a choice as all-embracing as its opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What we would learn today is more than just the lesson that you cannot see two worlds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It also teaches that the one you see is quite consistent from the point of view from which you see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is all a piece because it stems from one emotion, and reflects its source in everything you see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Six times today, in thanks and gratitude, we gladly give five minutes to the thought that ends all compromise and doubt, and go beyond them all as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will not make a thousand meaningless distinctions, nor attempt to bring with us a little part of unreality, as we devote our minds to finding only what is real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin your searching for the other world by asking for a strength beyond your own, and recognizing what it is you seek.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not want illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you come to these five minutes emptying your hands of all the petty treasures of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You wait for God to help you, as you say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"535#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is impossible to see two worlds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let me accept the strength God offers me and see no value in this world, that I may find my freedom and deliverance.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God will be there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you have called upon the great unfailing power which will take this giant step with you in gratitude.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor will you fail to see His thanks expressed in tangible perception and in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will not doubt what you will look upon, for though it is perception, it is not the kind of seeing that your eyes alone have ever seen before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you will know God‚Äôs strength upheld you as you made this choice.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Dismiss temptation easily today whenever it arises, merely by remembering the limits of your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The unreal or the real, the false or true is what you see and only what you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Perception is consistent with your choice, and hell or Heaven comes to you as one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"535#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Accept a little part of hell as real, and you have damned your eyes and cursed your sight, and what you will behold is hell indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the release of Heaven still remains within your range of choice, to take the place of everything that hell would show to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All you need say to any part of hell, whatever form it takes, is simply this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"535#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is impossible to see two worlds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"535#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I seek my freedom and deliverance, and this is not a part of what I want.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Perception is consistent.
