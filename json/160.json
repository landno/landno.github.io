data-sentence-id=\"160#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is trying to teach you how to gain the whole world and lose your own soul.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit teaches that you cannot lose your soul and there is no gain in the world, for of itself it profits nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To invest without profit is surely to impoverish yourself, and the overhead is high.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Not only is there no profit in the investment, but the cost to you is enormous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For this investment costs you the world’s reality by denying yours, and gives you nothing in return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot sell your soul, but you can sell your awareness of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You cannot perceive your soul, but you will not know it while you perceive something else as more valuable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"160#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is your strength because He knows nothing but the spirit as you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is perfectly aware that you do not know yourself, and perfectly aware of how to teach you to remember what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Because He loves you, He will gladly teach you what He loves, for He wills to share it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Remembering you always, He cannot let you forget your worth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the Father never ceases to remind Him of His Son, and He never ceases to remind His Son of the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God is in your memory because of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You chose to forget your Father but you do not really want to do so, and therefore you can decide otherwise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>As it was my decision, so is it yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"160#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not want the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The only thing of value in it is whatever part of it you look upon with love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This gives it the only reality it will ever have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its value is not in itself, but yours is in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As self-value comes from self-extension, so does the perception of self-value come from the extension of loving thoughts outward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Make the world real unto yourself, for the real world is the gift of the Holy Spirit, and so it belongs to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"160#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Correction is for all who cannot see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To open the eyes of the blind is the Holy Spirit’s mission, for He knows that they have not lost their vision, but merely sleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He would awaken them from the sleep of forgetting to the remembering of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Christ’s eyes are open, and He will look upon whatever you see with love if you accept His vision as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit keeps the vision of Christ for every Son of God who sleeps.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In His sight the Son of God is perfect, and He longs to share His vision with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He will show you the real world because God gave you Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Through Him your Father calls His Son to remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The awakening of His Son begins with his investment in the real world, and by this he will learn to re-invest in himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For reality is one with the Father and the Son, and the Holy Spirit blesses the real world in Their Name.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"160#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have seen this real world, as you will surely do, you will remember Us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you must learn the cost of sleeping, and refuse to pay it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only then will you decide to awaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And then the real world will spring to your sight, for Christ has never slept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is waiting to be seen, for He has never lost sight of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He looks quietly on the real world, which He would share with you because He knows of the Father’s Love for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And knowing this, He would give you what is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In perfect peace He waits for you at His Father’s altar, holding out the Father’s Love to you in the quiet light of the Holy Spirit’s blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For the Holy Spirit will lead everyone home to his Father, where Christ waits as his Self.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"160#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every child of God is one in Christ, for his being is in Christ as Christ’s is in God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Christ’s Love for you is His Love for His Father, which He knows because He knows His Father’s Love for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When the Holy Spirit has at last led you to Christ at the altar to His Father, perception fuses into knowledge because perception has become so holy that its transfer to holiness is merely its natural extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Love transfers to love without any interference, for the two are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As you perceive more and more common elements in all situations, the transfer of training under the Holy Spirit’s guidance increases and becomes generalized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Gradually you learn to apply it to everyone and everything, for its applicability is universal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When this has been accomplished, perception and knowledge have become so similar that they share the unification of the laws of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"160#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is one cannot be perceived as separate, and the denial of the separation is the reinstatement of knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>At the altar of God, the holy perception of God’s Son becomes so enlightened that light streams into it, and the spirit of God’s Son shines in the Mind of the Father and becomes one with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Very gently does God shine upon Himself, loving the extension of Himself that is His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The world has no purpose as it blends into the purpose of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the real world has slipped quietly into Heaven, where everything eternal in it has always been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There the Redeemer and the redeemed join in perfect love of God and of each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"160#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Heaven is your home, and being in God it must also be in you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The ego is trying
