class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have surely noticed an emphasis throughout our recent lessons on the connection between fulfilling your function and achieving happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is because you do not really see the connection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet there is more than just a connection between them; they are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Their forms are different, but their content is completely one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego does constant battle with the Holy Spirit on the fundamental question of what your function is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>So does it do constant battle with the Holy Spirit about what your happiness is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not a two-way battle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego attacks and the Holy Spirit does not respond.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He knows what your function is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He knows that it is your happiness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we will try to go past this wholly meaningless battle and arrive at the truth about your function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will not engage in senseless arguments about what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will not become hopelessly involved in defining happiness and determining the means for achieving it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We will not indulge the ego by listening to its attacks on truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We will merely be glad that we can find out what truth is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our longer practice period today has as its purpose your acceptance of the fact that not only is there a very real connection between the function God gave you and your happiness, but that they are actually identical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God gives you only happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, the function He gave you must be happiness, even if it appears to be different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Today’s exercises are an attempt to go beyond these differences in appearance, and recognize a common content where it exists in truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin the ten-to-fifteen-minute practice period by reviewing these thoughts:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"469#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God gives me only happiness.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has given my function to me.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore my function must be happiness.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"469#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Try to see the logic in this sequence, even if you do not yet accept the conclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is only if the first two thoughts are wrong that the conclusion could be false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let us, then, think about the premises for a while, as we are practicing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The first premise is that God gives you only happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This could be false, of course, but in order to be false it is necessary to define God as something He is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Love cannot give evil, and what is not happiness is evil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God cannot give what He does not have, and He cannot have what He is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Unless God gives you only happiness, He must be evil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And it is this definition of Him you are believing if you do not accept the first premise.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The second premise is that God has given you your function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We have seen that there are only two parts of your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>One is ruled by the ego, and is made up of illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The other is the home of the Holy Spirit, where truth abides.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There are no other guides but these to choose between, and no other outcomes possible as a result of your choice but the fear that the ego always engenders, and the love that the Holy Spirit always offers to replace it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus, it must be that your function is established by God through His Voice, or is made by the ego which you have made to replace Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Which is true?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Unless God gave your function to you, it must be the gift of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Does the ego really have gifts to give, being itself an illusion and offering only the illusion of gifts?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think about this during the longer practice period today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Think also about the many forms the illusion of your function has taken in your mind, and the many ways in which you tried to find salvation under the ego’s guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Did you find it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Were you happy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Did they bring you peace?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We need great honesty today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Remember the outcomes fairly, and consider also whether it was ever reasonable to expect happiness from anything the ego ever proposed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet the ego is the only alternative to the Holy Spirit’s Voice.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will listen to madness or hear the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try to make this choice as you think about the premises on which our conclusion rests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We can share in this conclusion, but in no other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For God Himself shares it with us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Today’s idea is another giant stride in the perception of the same as the same, and the different as different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>On one side stand all illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All truth stands on the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Let us try today to realize that only the truth is true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"469#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"469#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the shorter practice periods, which would be most helpful today if undertaken twice an hour, this form of the application is suggested:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"469#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>My happiness and function are one, because God has given me both.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"469#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It will not take more than a minute, and probably less, to repeat these words slowly and think about them a little while as you say them.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You have surely noticed an emphasis throughout our recent
