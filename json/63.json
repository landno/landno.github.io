data-sentence-id=\"063#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Atonement can only be accepted within you by releasing the inner light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Since the separation, defenses have been used almost entirely to defend <i>against</i> the Atonement, and thus maintain the separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is generally seen as a need to protect the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The many body fantasies in which minds engage arise from the distorted belief that the body can be used as a means for attaining “atonement.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perceiving the body as a temple is only the first step in correcting this distortion, because it alters only part of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It <i>does</i> recognize that Atonement in physical terms is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The next step, however, is to realize that a temple is not a structure at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Its true holiness lies at the inner altar around which the structure is built.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The emphasis on beautiful structures is a sign of the fear of Atonement, and an unwillingness to reach the altar itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The real beauty of the temple cannot be seen with the physical eye.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Spiritual sight, on the other hand, cannot see the structure at all because it is perfect vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>It can, however, see the altar with perfect clarity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"063#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For perfect effectiveness the Atonement belongs at the center of the inner altar, where it undoes the separation and restores the wholeness of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Before the separation the mind was invulnerable to fear, because fear did not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Both the separation and the fear are miscreations that must be undone for the restoration of the temple, and for the opening of the altar to receive the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This heals the separation by placing within you the one effective defense against all separation thoughts and making you perfectly invulnerable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"063#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This may appear to contradict free will because of the inevitability of the final decision, but this is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can temporize and you are capable of enormous procrastination, but you cannot depart entirely from your Creator, Who set the limits on your ability to miscreate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>An imprisoned will engenders a situation which, in the extreme, becomes altogether intolerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Tolerance for pain may be high, but it is not without limit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Eventually everyone begins to recognize, however dimly, that there <i>must</i> be a better way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As this recognition becomes more firmly established, it becomes a turning point.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This ultimately reawakens spiritual vision, simultaneously weakening the investment in physical sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The alternating investment in the two levels of perception is usually experienced as conflict, which can become very acute.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But the outcome is as certain as God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"063#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Spiritual vision literally cannot see error, and merely looks for Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All solutions the physical eye seeks dissolve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Spiritual vision looks within and recognizes immediately that the altar has been defiled and needs to be repaired and protected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perfectly aware of the right defense it passes over all others, looking past error to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Because of the strength of its vision, it brings the mind into its service.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This re-establishes the power of the mind and makes it increasingly unable to tolerate delay, realizing that it only adds unnecessary pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As a result, the mind becomes increasingly sensitive to what it would once have regarded as very minor intrusions of discomfort.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"063#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The children of God are entitled to the perfect comfort that comes from perfect trust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Until they achieve this, they waste themselves and their true creative powers on useless attempts to make themselves more comfortable by inappropriate means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But the real means are already provided, and do not involve any effort at all on their part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Atonement is the only gift that is worthy of being offered at the altar of God, because of the value of the altar itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It was created perfect and is entirely worthy of receiving perfection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God and His creations are completely dependent on Each Other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He depends on them <i>because</i> He created them perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He gave them His peace so they could not be shaken and could not be deceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Whenever you are afraid you <i>are</i> deceived, and your mind cannot serve the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This starves you by denying you your daily bread.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>God is lonely without His Sons, and they are lonely without Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>They must learn to look upon the world as a means of healing the separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"063#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>The Atonement is the guarantee that they will ultimately succeed.</span></p></div>
