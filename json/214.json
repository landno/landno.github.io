data-sentence-id=\"214#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy relationship is the expression of the holy instant in living in this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Like everything about salvation, the holy instant is a practical device, witnessed to by its results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The holy instant never fails.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The experience of it is always felt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet without expression it is not remembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The holy relationship is a constant reminder of the experience in which the relationship became what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And as the unholy relationship is a continuing hymn of hate in praise of its maker, so is the holy relationship a happy song of praise to the Redeemer of relationships.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy relationship, a major step toward the perception of the real world, is learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the old, unholy relationship, transformed and seen anew.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The holy relationship is a phenomenal teaching accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In all its aspects, as it begins, develops and becomes accomplished, it represents the reversal of the unholy relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be comforted in this; the only difficult phase is the beginning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For here, the goal of the relationship is abruptly shifted to the exact opposite of what it was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the first result of offering the relationship to the Holy Spirit, to use for His purposes.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This invitation is accepted immediately, and the Holy Spirit wastes no time in introducing the practical results of asking Him to enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>At once His goal replaces yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is accomplished very rapidly, but it makes the relationship seem disturbed, disjunctive and even quite distressing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The reason is quite clear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the relationship as it <i>is</i> is out of line with its own goal, and clearly unsuited to the purpose that has been accepted for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In its unholy condition, <i>your</i> goal was all that seemed to give it meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Now it seems to make no sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Many relationships have been broken off at this point, and the pursuit of the old goal re-established in another relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For once the unholy relationship has accepted the goal of holiness, it can never again be what it was.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The temptation of the ego becomes extremely intense with this shift in goals.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the relationship has not as yet been changed sufficiently to make its former goal completely without attraction, and its structure is “threatened” by the recognition of its inappropriateness for meeting its new purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The conflict between the goal and the structure of the relationship is so apparent that they cannot coexist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet now the goal will not be changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Set firmly in the unholy relationship, there is no course except to change the relationship to fit the goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Until this happy solution is seen and accepted as the only way out of the conflict, the relationship may seem to be severely strained.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It would not be kinder to shift the goal more slowly, for the contrast would be obscured, and the ego given time to reinterpret each slow step according to its liking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only a radical shift in purpose could induce a complete change of mind about what the whole relationship is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As this change develops and is finally accomplished, it grows increasingly beneficent and joyous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But at the beginning, the situation is experienced as very precarious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A relationship, undertaken by two individuals for their unholy purposes, suddenly has holiness for its goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As these two contemplate their relationship from the point of view of this new purpose, they are inevitably appalled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Their perception of the relationship may even become quite disorganized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And yet, the former organization of their perception no longer serves the purpose they have agreed to meet.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the time for <i>faith.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You let this goal be set for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That was an act of faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not abandon faith, now that the rewards of faith are being introduced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you believed the Holy Spirit was there to accept the relationship, why would you now not still believe that He is there to purify what He has taken under His guidance?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Have faith in your brother in what but seems to be a trying time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The goal <i>is</i> set.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And your relationship has sanity as its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For now you find yourself in an insane relationship, recognized as such in the light of its goal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now the ego counsels thus; substitute for this another relationship to which your former goal was quite appropriate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can escape from your distress only by getting rid of your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You need not part entirely if you choose not to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But you must exclude major areas of fantasy from your brother, to save your sanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span><i>Hear not this now!</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Have faith in Him Who answered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He heard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Has He not been very explicit in His answer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You are not now wholly insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Can you deny that He has given you a most explicit statement?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Now He asks for faith a little longer, even in bewilderment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>For this will go, and you will see the justification for your faith emerge, to bring you shining conviction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Abandon Him not now, nor your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#7:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>This relationship has been reborn as holy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Accept with gladness what you do not understand, and let it be explained to you as you perceive its purpose work in it to make it holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will find many opportunities to blame your brother for the “failure” of your relationship, for it will seem at times to have no purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A sense of aimlessness will come to haunt you, and to remind you of all the ways you once sought for satisfaction and thought you found it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Forget not now the misery you really found, and do not breathe life into your failing ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For your relationship has not been disrupted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It has been saved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are very new in the ways of salvation, and think you have lost your way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span><i>Your</i> way <i>is</i> lost, but think not this is loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In your newness, remember that you and your brother have started again, <i>together.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And take his hand, to walk together along a road far more familiar than you now believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is it not certain that you will remember a goal unchanged throughout eternity?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For you have chosen but the goal of God, from which your true intent was never absent.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Throughout the Sonship is the song of freedom heard, in joyous echo of your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have joined with many in the holy instant, and they have joined with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think not your choice will leave you comfortless, for God Himself has blessed your holy relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Join in His blessing, and withhold not yours upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For all it needs now is your blessing, that you may see that in it rests salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Condemn salvation not, for it has come to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And welcome it together, for it has come to join you and your brother together in a relationship in which all the Sonship is together blessed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You undertook, together, to invite the Holy Spirit into your relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He could not have entered otherwise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Although you may have made many mistakes since then, you have also made enormous efforts to help Him do His work.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And He has not been lacking in appreciation for all you have done for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor does He see the mistakes at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Have you been similarly grateful to your brother?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Have you consistently appreciated the good efforts, and overlooked mistakes?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Or has your appreciation flickered and grown dim in what seemed to be the light of the mistakes?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Perhaps you are now entering upon a campaign to blame him for the discomfort of the situation in which you find yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And by this lack of thanks and gratitude you make yourself unable to express the holy instant, and thus lose sight of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The experience of an instant, however compelling it may be, is easily forgotten if you allow time to close over it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It must be kept shining and gracious in your awareness of time, but not concealed within it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The instant remains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But where are you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To give thanks to your brother is to appreciate the holy instant, and thus enable its results to be accepted and shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To attack your brother is not to lose the instant, but to make it powerless in its effects.</span></p></div> <div

you may have established a condition in which you cannot use it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As a result, you do not realize that it is with you still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And by cutting yourself off from its expression, you have denied yourself its benefit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You reinforce this every time you attack your brother, for the attack must blind you to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is impossible to deny yourself, and to recognize what has been given and received by you.</span></p></div> <div

holy presence of truth itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is the goal, together with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think you not the goal itself will gladly arrange the means for its accomplishment?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is just this same discrepancy between the purpose that has been accepted and the means as they stand now which seems to make you suffer, but which makes Heaven glad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If Heaven were outside you, you could not share in its gladness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet because it is within, the gladness, too, is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You <i>are</i> joined in purpose, but remain still separate and divided on the means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#14:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet the goal is fixed, firm and unalterable, and the means will surely fall in place because the goal is sure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#14:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And you will share the gladness of the Sonship that it is so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"214#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

accept the effects of the holy instant and use them to correct all your mistakes and free you from their results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"214#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And learning this, you will have also learned how to release all the Sonship, and offer it in gladness and thanksgiving to Him Who gave you your release, and Who would extend it through you.</span></p></div>
