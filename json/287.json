data-sentence-id=\"287#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To the extent to which you value guilt, to that extent will you perceive a world in which attack is justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To the extent to which you recognize that guilt is meaningless, to that extent you will perceive attack cannot <i>be</i> justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is in accord with perception’s fundamental law: You see what you believe is there, and you believe it there because you want it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perception has no other law than this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The rest but stems from this, to hold it up and offer it support.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is perception’s form, adapted to this world, of God’s more basic law; that love creates itself, and nothing but itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"287#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s laws do not obtain directly to a world perception rules, for such a world could not have been created by the Mind to which perception has no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet are His laws reflected everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Not that the world where this reflection is, is real at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only because His Son believes it is, and from His Son’s belief He could not let Himself be separate entirely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He could not enter His Son’s insanity with him, but He could be sure His sanity went there with him, so he could not be lost forever in the madness of his wish.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"287#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perception rests on choosing; knowledge does not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Knowledge has but one law because it has but one Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But this world has two who made it, and they do not see it as the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To each it has a different purpose, and to each it is a perfect means to serve the goal for which it is perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For specialness, it is the perfect frame to set it off; the perfect battleground to wage its wars, the perfect shelter for illusions which it would make real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Not one but it upholds in its perception; not one but can be fully justified.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"287#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is another Maker of the world, the simultaneous Corrector of the mad belief that anything could be established and maintained without some link that kept it still within the laws of God; not as the law itself upholds the universe as God created it, but in some form adapted to the need the Son of God believes he has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Corrected error is the error’s end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus has God protected still His Son, even in error.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"287#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is another purpose in the world that error made, because it has another Maker Who can reconcile its goal with His Creator’s purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In His perception of the world, nothing is seen but justifies forgiveness and the sight of perfect sinlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing arises but is met with instant and complete forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing remains an instant, to obscure the sinlessness that shines unchanged, beyond the pitiful attempts of specialness to put it out of mind, where it must be, and light the body up instead of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The lamps of Heaven are not for mind to choose to see them where it will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it elects to see them elsewhere from their home, as if they lit a place where they could never be, then must the Maker of the world correct your error, lest you remain in darkness where the lamps are not.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"287#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone here has entered darkness, yet no one has entered it alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor need he stay more than an instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For he has come with Heaven’s Help within him, ready to lead him out of darkness into light at any time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The time he chooses can be any time, for help is there, awaiting but his choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And when he chooses to avail himself of what is given him, then will he see each situation that he thought before was means to justify his anger turned to an event which justifies his love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He will hear plainly that the calls to war he heard before are really calls to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He will perceive that where he gave attack is but another altar where he can, with equal ease and far more happiness, bestow forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And he will reinterpret all temptation as just another chance to bring him joy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"287#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can a misperception be a sin?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let all your brother’s errors be to you nothing except a chance for you to see the workings of the Helper given you to see the world He made instead of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What, then, <i>is</i> justified?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What do you want?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For these two questions are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And when you see them as the same, your choice is made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For it is seeing them as one that brings release from the belief there are two ways to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This world has much to offer to your peace, and many chances to extend your own forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Such its purpose is, to those who want to see peace and forgiveness descend on them, and offer them the light.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"287#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Maker of the world of gentleness has perfect power to offset the world of violence and hate that seems to stand between you and His gentleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not there in His forgiving eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And therefore it need not be there in yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Sin is the fixed belief perception cannot change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What has been damned is damned and damned forever, being forever unforgivable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If, then, it is forgiven, sin’s perception must have been wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And thus is change made possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Holy Spirit, too, sees what He sees as far beyond the chance of change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But on His vision sin cannot encroach, for sin has been corrected by His sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And thus it must have been an error, not a sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>For what it claimed could never be, has been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Sin is attacked by punishment, and so preserved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>But to forgive it is to change its state from error into truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"287#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Son of God could never sin, but he can wish for what would hurt him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And he has the power to think he can be hurt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What could this be except a misperception of himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is this a sin or a mistake, forgivable or not?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Does he need help or condemnation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Is it your purpose that he be saved or damned?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Forgetting not that what he is to you will make this choice your future?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For you make it <i>now,</i> the instant when all time becomes a means to reach a goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Make, then, your choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"287#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But recognize that in this choice the purpose of the world you see is chosen, and will be justified.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"To the extent to which you value
