Guest","inlineNumber":"II."},"annotation":"T-29.II","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-29-sect-2\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why would you not perceive it as release from suffering to learn that you are free?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Why would you not acclaim the truth instead of looking on it as an enemy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Why does an easy path, so clearly marked it is impossible to lose the way, seem thorny, rough and far too difficult for you to follow?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is it not because you see it as the road to hell instead of looking on it as a simple way, without a sacrifice or any loss, to find yourself in Heaven and in God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Until you realize you give up nothing, until you understand there is no loss, you will have some regrets about the way that you have chosen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will not see the many gains your choice has offered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet though you do not see them, they are there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Their cause has been effected, and they must be present where their cause has entered in.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have accepted healing’s cause, and so it must be you are healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And being healed, the power to heal must also now be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The miracle is not a separate thing that happens suddenly, as an effect without a cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor is it, in itself, a cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But where its cause is must it be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Now is it caused, though not as yet perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And its effects are there, though not yet seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Look inward now, and you will not behold a reason for regret, but cause indeed for glad rejoicing and for hope of peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It has been hopeless to attempt to find the hope of peace upon a battleground.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has been futile to demand escape from sin and pain of what was made to serve the function of retaining sin and pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For pain and sin are one illusion, as are hate and fear, attack and guilt but one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where they are causeless their effects are gone, and love must come wherever they are not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Why are you not rejoicing?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are free of pain and sickness, misery and loss, and all effects of hatred and attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No more is pain your friend and guilt your god, and you should welcome the effects of love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your Guest <i>has</i> come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You asked Him, and He came.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You did not hear Him enter, for you did not wholly welcome Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet His gifts came with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has laid them at your feet, and asks you now that you will look on them and take them for your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He needs your help in giving them to all who walk apart, believing they are separate and alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They will be healed when you accept your gifts, because your Guest will welcome everyone whose feet have touched the holy ground whereon you stand, and where His gifts for them are laid.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not see how much you now can give, because of everything you have received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet He Who entered in but waits for you to come where you invited Him to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no other place where He can find His host, nor where His host can meet with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And nowhere else His gifts of peace and joy, and all the happiness His Presence brings, can be obtained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For they are where He is Who brought them with Him, that they might be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot see your Guest, but you can see the gifts He brought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And when you look on them, you will believe His Presence must be there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For what you now can do could not be done without the love and grace His Presence holds.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is the promise of the living God; His Son have life and every living thing be part of him, and nothing else have life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What you have given “life” is not alive, and symbolizes but your wish to be alive apart from life; alive in death, with death perceived as life, and living, death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Confusion follows on confusion here, for on confusion has this world been based, and there is nothing else it rests upon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its basis does not change, although it seems to be in constant change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet what is that except the state confusion really means?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Stability to those who are confused is meaningless, and shift and change become the law on which they predicate their lives.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body does not change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It represents the larger dream that change is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To change is to attain a state unlike the one in which you found yourself before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no change in immortality, and Heaven knows it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet here on earth it has a double purpose, for it can be made to teach opposing things.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And they reflect the teacher who is teaching them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The body can appear to change with time, with sickness or with health, and with events that seem to alter it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet this but means the mind remains unchanged in its belief of what the purpose of the body is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness is a demand the body be a thing that it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its nothingness is guarantee that it can <i>not</i> be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In your demand that it be more than this lies the idea of sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For it asks that God be less than all He really is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What, then, becomes of you, for it is you of whom the sacrifice is asked?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For He is told that part of Him belongs to Him no longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He must sacrifice your self, and in His sacrifice are you made more and He is lessened by the loss of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And what is gone from Him becomes your god, protecting you from being part of Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body that is asked to be a god will be attacked, because its nothingness has not been recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so it seems to be a thing with power in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As something, it can be perceived and thought to feel and act, and hold you in its grasp as prisoner to itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it can fail to be what you demanded that it be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you will hate it for its littleness, unmindful that the failure does not lie in that it is not more than it should be, but only in your failure to perceive that it is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet its nothingness is your salvation, from which you would flee.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"324#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As “something” is the body asked to be God’s enemy, replacing what He is with littleness and limit and despair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is His loss you celebrate when you behold the body as a thing you love, or look upon it as a thing you hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For if He be the sum of everything, then what is not in Him does not exist, and His completion is its nothingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your savior is not dead, nor does he dwell in what was built as temple unto death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He lives in God, and it is this that makes him savior unto you, and only this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His body’s nothingness releases yours from sickness and from death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"324#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For what is yours cannot be more or less than what is his.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Why would you not perceive it as release from suffering to learn that you are free?
