class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All temptation is nothing more than some form of the basic temptation not to believe the idea for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Salvation seems to come from anywhere except from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>So, too, does the source of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You see neither guilt nor salvation as in your own mind and nowhere else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When you realize that all guilt is solely an invention of your mind, you also realize that guilt and salvation must be in the same place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In understanding this you are saved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"473#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The seeming cost of accepting today‚Äôs idea is this: It means that nothing outside yourself can save you; nothing outside yourself can give you peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But it also means that nothing outside yourself can hurt you, or disturb your peace or upset you in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Today‚Äôs idea places you in charge of the universe, where you belong because of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is not a role that can be partially accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you must surely begin to see that accepting it is salvation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"473#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It may not, however, be clear to you why the recognition that guilt is in your own mind entails the realization that salvation is there as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God would not have put the remedy for the sickness where it cannot help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is the way your mind has worked, but hardly His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He wants you to be healed, so He has kept the Source of healing where the need for healing lies.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"473#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have tried to do just the opposite, making every attempt, however distorted and fantastic it might be, to separate healing from the sickness for which it was intended, and thus keep the sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your purpose was to ensure that healing did not occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God‚Äôs purpose was to ensure that it did.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"473#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we practice realizing that God‚Äôs Will and ours are really the same in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God wants us to be healed, and we do not really want to be sick, because it makes us unhappy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore, in accepting the idea for today, we are really in agreement with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He does not want us to be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Neither do we.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He wants us to be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>So do we.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"473#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We are ready for two longer practice periods today, each of which should last some ten to fifteen minutes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will, however, still let you decide when to undertake them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will follow this practice for a number of lessons, and it would again be well to decide in advance when would be a good time to lay aside for each of them, and then adhering to your own decisions as closely as possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"473#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin these practice periods by repeating the idea for today, adding a statement signifying your recognition that salvation comes from nothing outside of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You might put it this way:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"473#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>My salvation comes from me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It cannot come from anywhere else.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"473#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Then devote a few minutes, with your eyes closed, to reviewing some of the external places where you have looked for salvation in the past;‚Äîin other people, in possessions, in various situations and events, and in self-concepts that you sought to make real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Recognize that it is not there, and tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"473#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>My salvation cannot come from any of these things.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>My salvation comes from me and only from me.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"473#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now we will try again to reach the light in you, which is where your salvation is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot find it in the clouds that surround the light, and it is in them you have been looking for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is past the clouds and in the light beyond.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember that you will have to go through the clouds before you can reach the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But remember also that you have never found anything in the cloud patterns you imagined that endured, or that you wanted.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"473#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Since all illusions of salvation have failed you, surely you do not want to remain in the clouds, looking vainly for idols there, when you could so easily walk on into the light of real salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try to pass the clouds by whatever means appeals to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If it helps you, think of me holding your hand and leading you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"473#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For the short and frequent practice periods today, remind yourself that your salvation comes from you, and nothing but your own thoughts can hamper your progress.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are free from all external interference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are in charge of your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are in charge of the salvation of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Say, then:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"473#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>My salvation comes from me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing outside of me can hold me back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"473#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Within me is the world‚Äôs salvation and my own.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"All temptation is nothing more than some form of the basic temptation not to believe the idea for today.
