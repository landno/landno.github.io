answers to your call!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And think how holy he must be when in him sleeps your own salvation, with his freedom joined!</span> <span

know He is in you as well while you attack His chosen home, and battle with His host.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Regard him gently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Look with loving eyes on him who carries Christ within him, that you may behold his glory and rejoice that Heaven is not separate from you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"303#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is it too much to ask a little trust for him who carries Christ to you, that you may be forgiven all your sins, and left without a single one you cherish still?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Forget not that a shadow held between your brother and yourself obscures the face of Christ and memory of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And would you trade Them for an ancient hate?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ground whereon you stand is holy ground because of Them Who, standing there with you, have blessed it with Their innocence and peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"303#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span

<span data-sentence-id=\"303#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What was a place of death has now become a living temple in a world of light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Because of Them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is Their Presence which has lifted holiness again to take its ancient place upon an ancient throne.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Because of Them have miracles sprung up as grass and flowers on the barren ground that hate had scorched and rendered desolate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What hate has wrought have They undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#3:7\"><span

ancient hate has gone, and all the blight and withering have passed forever from the land where They have come.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"303#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

data-sentence-id=\"303#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When They come, time’s purpose is fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What never was passes to nothingness when They have come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What hatred claimed is given up to love, and freedom lights up every living thing and lifts it into Heaven, where the lights grow ever brighter as each one comes home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The incomplete is made complete again, and Heaven’s joy has been increased because what is its own has been restored to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The bloodied earth is cleansed, and the insane have shed their garments of insanity to join Them on the ground whereon you stand.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"303#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span

given up, that light may shine on it and leave no space nor distance lingering between the light of Heaven and the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"303#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

resting place as well as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What hatred has released to love becomes the brightest light in Heaven’s radiance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And all the lights in Heaven brighter grow, in gratitude for what has been restored.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"303#7\"><p

keep the light where it has entered in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your footprints lighten up the world, for where you walk forgiveness gladly goes with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one on earth but offers thanks to one who has restored his home, and sheltered him from bitter winter and the freezing cold.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And shall the Lord of Heaven and His Son give less in gratitude for so much more?</span></p></div> <div

host again to Him by Whom it was created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Where He dwells, His Son dwells with Him, never separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And They give thanks that They are welcome made at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where stood a cross stands now the risen Christ, and ancient scars are healed within His sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>An ancient miracle has come to bless and to replace an ancient enmity that came to kill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In gentle gratitude do God the Father and the Son return to what is Theirs, and will forever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Now is the Holy Spirit’s purpose done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"303#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For They
