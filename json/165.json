<span data-sentence-id=\"165#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Earlier, I said that the Holy Spirit shares the goal of all good teachers, whose ultimate aim is to make themselves unnecessary by teaching their pupils all they know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit wants only this, for sharing the Father’s Love for His Son, He seeks to remove all guilt from his mind that he may remember his Father in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Peace and guilt are antithetical, and the Father can be remembered only in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Love and guilt cannot coexist, and to accept one is to deny the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Guilt hides Christ from your sight, for it is the denial of the blamelessness of God’s Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the strange world that you have made the Son of God <i>has</i> sinned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How could you see him, then?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By making him invisible, the world of retribution rose in the black cloud of guilt that you accepted, and you hold it dear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the blamelessness of Christ is the proof that the ego never was, and can never be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Without guilt the ego has no life, and God’s Son <i>is</i> without guilt.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As you look upon yourself and judge what you do honestly, you may be tempted to wonder how you can be guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet consider this: You are not guiltless in time, but in eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have “sinned” in the past, but there is no past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Always has no direction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Time seems to go in one direction, but when you reach its end it will roll up like a long carpet spread along the past behind you, and will disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As long as you believe the Son of God is guilty you will walk along this carpet, believing that it leads to death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And the journey will seem long and cruel and senseless, for so it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The journey the Son of God has set himself is useless indeed, but the journey on which his Father sets him is one of release and joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Father is not cruel, and His Son cannot hurt himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The retaliation that he fears and that he sees will never touch him, for although he believes in it the Holy Spirit knows it is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit stands at the end of time, where you must be because He is with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has already undone everything unworthy of the Son of God, for such was His mission, given Him by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what God gives has always been.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will see me as you learn the Son of God is guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He has always sought his guiltlessness, and he has found it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For everyone is seeking to escape from the prison he has made, and the way to find release is not denied him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Being in him, he has found it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span><i>When</i> he finds it is only a matter of time, and time is but an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the Son of God is guiltless now, and the brightness of his purity shines untouched forever in God’s Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God’s Son will always be as he was created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Deny your world and judge him not, for his eternal guiltlessness is in the Mind of his Father, and protects him forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have accepted the Atonement for yourself, you will realize there is no guilt in God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And only as you look upon him as guiltless can you understand his oneness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the idea of guilt brings a belief in condemnation of one by another, projecting separation in place of unity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can condemn only yourself, and by so doing you cannot know that you are God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have denied the condition of his being, which is his perfect blamelessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Out of love he was created, and in love he abides.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Goodness and mercy have always followed him, for he has always extended the Love of his Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As you perceive the holy companions who travel with you, you will realize that there is no journey, but only an awakening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Son of God, who sleepeth not, has kept faith with his Father for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no road to travel on, and no time to travel through.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For God waits not for His Son in time, being forever unwilling to be without him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so it has always been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let the holiness of God’s Son shine away the cloud of guilt that darkens your mind, and by accepting his purity as yours, learn of him that it <i>is</i> yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are invulnerable because you are guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can hold on to the past only through guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For guilt establishes that you will be punished for what you have done, and thus depends on one-dimensional time, proceeding from past to future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one who believes this can understand what “always” means, and therefore guilt must deprive you of the appreciation of eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are immortal because you are eternal, and “always” must be now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Guilt, then, is a way of holding past and future in your mind to ensure the ego’s continuity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For if what has been will be punished, the ego’s continuity is guaranteed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet the guarantee of your continuity is God’s, not the ego’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And immortality is the opposite of time, for time passes away, while immortality is constant.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Accepting the Atonement teaches you what immortality is, for by accepting your guiltlessness you learn that the past has never been, and so the future is needless and will not be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The future, in time, is always associated with expiation, and only guilt could induce a sense of a need for expiation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Accepting the guiltlessness of the Son of God as yours is therefore God’s way of reminding you of His Son, and what he is in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For God has never condemned His Son, and being guiltless he is eternal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot dispel guilt by making it real, and then atoning for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the ego’s plan, which it offers instead of dispelling it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego believes in atonement through attack, being fully committed to the insane notion that attack is salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you who cherish guilt must also believe it, for how else but by identifying with the ego could you hold dear what you do not want?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"165#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego teaches you to attack yourself because you are guilty, and this must increase the guilt, for guilt is the result of attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the ego’s teaching, then, there is no escape from guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For attack makes guilt real, and if it is real there <i>is</i> no way to overcome it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit dispels it simply through the calm recognition that it has never been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As He looks upon the guiltless Son of God, He knows that this is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And being true for you, you cannot attack yourself, for without guilt attack is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You, then, are saved because God’s Son is guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"165#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And being wholly pure, you are invulnerable.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Earlier, I said that the Holy Spirit shares the goal of
