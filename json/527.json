eyes as you awake, and gives you joy with which to meet the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It soothes your forehead while you sleep, and rests upon your eyelids so you see no dreams of fear and evil, malice and attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And when you wake again, it offers you another day of happiness and peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All this forgiveness offers you, and more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness lets the veil be lifted up that hides the face of Christ from those who look with unforgiving eyes upon the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It lets you recognize the Son of God, and clears your memory of all dead thoughts so that remembrance of your Father can arise across the threshold of your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What would you want forgiveness cannot give?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What gifts but these are worthy to be sought?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What fancied value, trivial effect or transient promise, never to be kept, can hold more hope than what forgiveness brings?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why would you seek an answer other than the answer that will answer everything?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is the perfect answer, given to imperfect questions, meaningless requests, halfhearted willingness to hear, and less than halfway diligence and partial trust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here is the answer!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Seek for it no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will not find another one instead.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s plan for your salvation cannot change, nor can it fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be thankful it remains exactly as He planned it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Changelessly it stands before you like an open door, with warmth and welcome calling from beyond the doorway, bidding you to enter in and make yourself at home, where you belong.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the answer!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you stand outside while all of Heaven waits for you within?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgive and be forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As you give you will receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no plan but this for the salvation of the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let us today rejoice that this is so, for here we have an answer, clear and plain, beyond deceit in its simplicity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All the complexities the world has spun of fragile cobwebs disappear before the power and the majesty of this extremely simple statement of the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the answer!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not turn away in aimless wandering again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Accept salvation now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the gift of God, and not the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The world can give no gifts of any value to a mind that has received what God has given as its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God wills salvation be received today, and that the intricacies of your dreams no longer hide their nothingness from you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Open your eyes today and look upon a happy world of safety and of peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Forgiveness is the means by which it comes to take the place of hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In quietness it rises up to greet your open eyes, and fill your heart with deep tranquility as ancient truths, forever newly born, arise in your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you will remember then can never be described.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet your forgiveness offers it to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remembering the gifts forgiveness gives, we undertake our practicing today with hope and faith that this will be the day salvation will be ours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Earnestly and gladly will we seek for it today, aware we hold the key within our hands, accepting Heaven’s answer to the hell we made, but where we would remain no more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Morning and evening do we gladly give a quarter of an hour to the search in which the end of hell is guaranteed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Begin in hopefulness, for we have reached the turning point at which the road becomes far easier.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And now the way is short that yet we travel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We are close indeed to the appointed ending of the dream.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sink into happiness as you begin these practice periods, for they hold out the sure rewards of questions answered and what your acceptance of the answer brings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today it will be given you to feel the peace forgiveness offers, and the joy the lifting of the veil holds out to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Before the light you will receive today the world will fade until it disappears, and you will see another world arise you have no words to picture.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now we walk directly into light, and we receive the gifts that have been held in store for us since time began, kept waiting for today.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness offers everything you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today all things you want are given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let not your gifts recede throughout the day, as you return again to meet a world of shifting change and bleak appearances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Retain your gifts in clear awareness as you see the changeless in the heart of change; the light of truth behind appearances.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"527#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be tempted not to let your gifts slip by and drift into forgetfulness, but hold them firmly in your mind by your attempts to think of them at least a minute as each quarter of an hour passes by.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Remind yourself how precious are these gifts with this reminder, which has power to hold your gifts in your awareness through the day:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"527#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiveness offers everything I want.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Today I have accepted this as true.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"527#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Today I have received the gifts of God.</span></p></div>
