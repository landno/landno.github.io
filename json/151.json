Redemption","inlineNumber":"VI."},"annotation":"T-11.VI","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-11-sect-6\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible not to believe what you see, but it is equally impossible to see what you do not believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perceptions are built up on the basis of experience, and experience leads to beliefs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not until beliefs are fixed that perceptions stabilize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In effect, then, what you believe you <i>do</i> see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is what I meant when I said, “Blessed are ye who have not seen and still believe,” for those who believe in the resurrection will see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The resurrection is the complete triumph of Christ over the ego, not by attack but by transcendence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For Christ does rise above the ego and all its works, and ascends to the Father and His Kingdom.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you join in the resurrection or the crucifixion?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you condemn your brothers or free them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you transcend your prison and ascend to the Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>These questions are all the same, and are answered together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There has been much confusion about what perception means, because the word is used both for awareness and for the interpretation of awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet you cannot be aware without interpretation, for what you perceive <i>is</i> your interpretation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This course is perfectly clear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you do not see it clearly, it is because you are interpreting against it, and therefore do not believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And since belief determines perception, you do not perceive what it means and therefore do not accept it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet different experiences lead to different beliefs, and with them different perceptions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For perceptions are learned <i>with</i> beliefs, and experience does teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I am leading you to a new kind of experience that you will become less and less willing to deny.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Learning of Christ is easy, for to perceive with Him involves no strain at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>His perceptions are your natural awareness, and it is only the distortions you introduce that tire you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let the Christ in you interpret for you, and do not try to limit what you see by narrow little beliefs that are unworthy of God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For until Christ comes into His Own, the Son of God will see himself as Fatherless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I am <i>your</i> resurrection and <i>your</i> life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You live in me because you live in God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And everyone lives in you, as you live in everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Can you, then, perceive unworthiness in a brother and not perceive it in yourself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And can you perceive it in yourself and not perceive it in God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Believe in the resurrection because it has been accomplished, and it has been accomplished in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is as true now as it will ever be, for the resurrection is the Will of God, which knows no time and no exceptions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But make no exceptions yourself, or you will not perceive what has been accomplished for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For we ascend unto the Father together, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, for such is the nature of God’s Son as his Father created him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not underestimate the power of the devotion of God’s Son, nor the power the god he worships has over him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For he places himself at the altar of his god, whether it be the god he made or the God Who created him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is why his slavery is as complete as his freedom, for he will obey only the god he accepts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The god of crucifixion demands that he crucify, and his worshippers obey.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In his name they crucify themselves, believing that the power of the Son of God is born of sacrifice and pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The God of resurrection demands nothing, for He does not will to take away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He does not require obedience, for obedience implies submission.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He would only have you learn your will and follow it, not in the spirit of sacrifice and submission, but in the gladness of freedom.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Resurrection must compel your allegiance gladly, because it is the symbol of joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its whole compelling power lies in the fact that it represents what you want to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The freedom to leave behind everything that hurts you and humbles you and frightens you cannot be thrust upon you, but it can be offered you through the grace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you can accept it by His grace, for God is gracious to His Son, accepting him without question as His Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who, then, is <i>your</i> own?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Father has given you all that is His, and He Himself is yours with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Guard them in their resurrection, for otherwise you will not awake in God, safely surrounded by what is yours forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will not find peace until you have removed the nails from the hands of God’s Son, and taken the last thorn from his forehead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Love of God surrounds His Son whom the god of crucifixion condemns.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Teach not that I died in vain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Teach rather that I did not die by demonstrating that I live in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the undoing of the crucifixion of God’s Son is the work of the redemption, in which everyone has a part of equal value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God does not judge His guiltless Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Having given Himself to him, how could it be otherwise?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have nailed yourself to a cross, and placed a crown of thorns upon your own head.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you cannot crucify God’s Son, for the Will of God cannot die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Son has been redeemed from his own crucifixion, and you cannot assign to death whom God has given eternal life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The dream of crucifixion still lies heavy on your eyes, but what you see in dreams is not reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>While you perceive the Son of God as crucified, you are asleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And as long as you believe that you can crucify him, you are only having nightmares.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You who are beginning to wake are still aware of dreams, and have not yet forgotten them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The forgetting of dreams and the awareness of Christ come with the awakening of others to share your redemption.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will awaken to your own call, for the Call to awake is within you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If I live in you, you are awake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you must see the works I do through you, or you will not perceive that I have done them unto you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not set limits on what you believe I can do through you, or you will not accept what I can do <i>for</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it is done already, and unless you give all that you have received you will not know that your redeemer liveth, and that you have awakened with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Redemption is recognized only by sharing it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"151#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s Son <i>is</i> saved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Bring only this awareness to the Sonship, and you will have a part in the redemption as valuable as mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For your part must be like mine if you learn it of me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you believe that yours is limited, you are limiting mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no order of difficulty in miracles because all of God’s Sons are of equal value, and their equality is their oneness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The whole power of God is in every part of Him, and nothing contradictory to His Will is either great or small.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What does not exist has no size and no measure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To God all things are possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"151#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And to Christ it is given to be like the Father.</span></p></div>
