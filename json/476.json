class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we are considering the will you share with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not the same as the ego’s idle wishes, out of which darkness and nothingness arise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The will you share with God has all the power of creation in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego’s idle wishes are unshared, and therefore have no power at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its wishes are not idle in the sense that they can make a world of illusions in which your belief can be very strong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But they are idle indeed in terms of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They make nothing that is real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Idle wishes and grievances are partners or co-makers in picturing the world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The wishes of the ego gave rise to it, and the ego’s need for grievances, which are necessary to maintain it, peoples it with figures that seem to attack you and call for “righteous” judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These figures become the middlemen the ego employs to traffic in grievances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They stand between your awareness and your brothers’ reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Beholding them, you do not know your brothers or your Self.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your will is lost to you in this strange bartering, in which guilt is traded back and forth, and grievances increase with each exchange.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can such a world have been created by the Will the Son of God shares with his Father?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Did God create disaster for His Son?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Creation is the Will of Both together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would God create a world that kills Himself?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we will try once more to reach the world that is in accordance with your will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The light is in it because it does not oppose the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not Heaven, but the light of Heaven shines on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Darkness has vanished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego’s idle wishes have been withdrawn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet the light that shines upon this world reflects your will, and so it must be in you that we will look for it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your picture of the world can only mirror what is within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The source of neither light nor darkness can be found without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Grievances darken your mind, and you look out on a darkened world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Forgiveness lifts the darkness, reasserts your will, and lets you look upon a world of light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We have repeatedly emphasized that the barrier of grievances is easily passed, and cannot stand between you and your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The reason is very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do you really want to be in hell?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do you really want to weep and suffer and die?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forget the ego’s arguments which seek to prove all this is really Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You know it is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot want this for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is a point beyond which illusions cannot go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Suffering is not happiness, and it is happiness you really want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Such is your will in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so salvation is your will as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You want to succeed in what we are trying to do today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>We undertake it with your blessing and your glad accord.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will succeed today if you remember that you want salvation for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You want to accept God’s plan because you share in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have no will that can really oppose it, and you do not want to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation is for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Above all else, you want the freedom to remember Who you really are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Today it is the ego that stands powerless before your will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your will is free, and nothing can prevail against it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Therefore, we undertake the exercises for today in happy confidence, certain that we will find what it is your will to find, and remember what it is your will to remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No idle wishes can detain us, nor deceive us with an illusion of strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Today let your will be done, and end forever the insane belief that it is hell in place of Heaven that you choose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will begin our longer practice periods with the recognition that God’s plan for salvation, and only His, is wholly in accord with your will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not the purpose of an alien power, thrust upon you unwillingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the one purpose here on which you and your Father are in perfect accord.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will succeed today, the time appointed for the release of the Son of God from hell and from all idle wishes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His will is now restored to his awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is willing this very day to look upon the light in him and be saved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>After reminding yourself of this, and determining to keep your will clearly in mind, tell yourself with gentle firmness and quiet certainty:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"476#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I will there be light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let me behold the light that reflects God’s Will and mine.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"476#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then let your will assert itself, joined with the power of God and united with your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Put the rest of the practice period under Their guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Join with Them as They lead the way.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"476#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the shorter practice periods, again make a declaration of what you really want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"476#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I will there be light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Darkness is not my will.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"476#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This should be repeated several times an hour.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is most important, however, to apply today’s idea in this form immediately you are tempted to hold a grievance of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"476#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This will help you let your grievances go, instead of cherishing them and hiding them in darkness.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today we are considering the will you
