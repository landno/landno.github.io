Profession?","inlineNumber":"II."},"annotation":"P-3.II","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text psycho-3-sect-2\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Strictly speaking the answer is no.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How could a separate profession be one in which everyone is engaged?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And how could any limits be laid on an interaction in which everyone is both patient and therapist in every relationship in which he enters?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet practically speaking, it can still be said that there are those who devote themselves primarily to healing of one sort or another as their chief function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is to them that a large number of others turn for help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That, in effect, is the practice of therapy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>These are therefore “officially” helpers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They are devoted to certain kinds of needs in their professional activities, although they may be far more able teachers outside of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>These people need no special rules, of course, but they may be called upon to use special applications of the general principles of healing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>First, the professional therapist is in an excellent position to demonstrate that there is no order of difficulty in healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this, however, he needs special training, because the curriculum by which he became a therapist probably taught him little or nothing about the real principles of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In fact, it probably taught him how to make healing impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Most of the world’s teaching follows a curriculum in judgment, with the aim of making the therapist a judge.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Even this the Holy Spirit can use, and will use, given the slightest invitation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The unhealed healer may be arrogant, selfish, unconcerned, and actually dishonest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He may be uninterested in healing as his major goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet something happened to him, however slight it may have been, when he chose to be a healer, however misguided the direction he may have chosen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That “something” is enough.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Sooner or later that something will rise and grow; a patient will touch his heart, and the therapist will silently ask him for help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He has himself found a therapist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He has asked the Holy Spirit to enter the relationship and heal it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He has accepted the Atonement for himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God is said to have looked on all He created and pronounced it good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No, He declared it perfect, and so it was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And since His creations do not change and last forever, so it is now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet neither a perfect therapist nor a perfect patient can possibly exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Both must have denied their perfection, for their very need for each other implies a sense of lack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A one-to-one relationship is not One Relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet it is the means of return; the way God chose for the return of His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In that strange dream a strange correction must enter, for only that is the call to awake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And what else should therapy be?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Awake and be glad, for all your sins have been forgiven you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This is the only message that any two should ever give each other.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Something good must come from every meeting of patient and therapist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And that good is saved for both, against the day when they can recognize that only that was real in their relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>At that moment the good is returned to them, blessed by the Holy Spirit as a gift from their Creator as a sign of His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the therapeutic relationship must become like the relationship of the Father and the Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no other, for there is nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The therapists of this world do not expect this outcome, and many of their patients would not be able to accept help from them if they did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet no therapist really sets the goal for the relationships of which he is a part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>His understanding begins with recognizing this, and then goes on from there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is in the instant that the therapist forgets to judge the patient that healing occurs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In some relationships this point is never reached, although both patient and therapist may change their dreams in the process.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it will not be the same dream for both of them, and so it is not the dream of forgiveness in which both will someday wake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The good is saved; indeed is cherished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But only little time is saved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The new dreams will lose their temporary appeal and turn to dreams of fear, which is the content of all dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet no patient can accept more than he is ready to receive, and no therapist can offer more than he believes he has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so there is a place for all relationships in this world, and they will bring as much good as each can accept and use.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet it is when judgment ceases that healing occurs, because only then it can be understood that there is no order of difficulty in healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is a necessary understanding for the healed healer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has learned that it is no harder to wake a brother from one dream than from another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No professional therapist can hold this understanding consistently in his mind, offering it to all who come to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There are some in this world who have come very close, but they have not accepted the gift entirely in order to stay and let their understanding remain on earth until the closing of time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They could hardly be called professional therapists.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are the Saints of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They are the Saviors of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Their image remains, because they have chosen that it be so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>They take the place of other images, and help with kindly dreams.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Once the professional therapist has realized that minds are joined, he can also recognize that order of difficulty in healing is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet well before he reaches this in time he can go towards it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Many holy instants can be his along the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A goal marks the end of a journey, not the beginning, and as each goal is reached another can be dimly seen ahead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Most professional therapists are still at the very start of the beginning stage of the first journey.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Even those who have begun to understand what they must do may still oppose the setting-out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet all the laws of healing can be theirs in just an instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The journey is not long except in dreams.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The professional therapist has one advantage that can save enormous time if it is properly used.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He has chosen a road in which there is great temptation to misuse his role.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This enables him to pass by many obstacles to peace quite quickly, if he escapes the temptation to assume a function that has not been given him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To understand there is no order of difficulty in healing, he must also recognize the equality of himself and the patient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no halfway point in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Either they are equal or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The attempts of therapists to compromise in this respect are strange indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Some utilize the relationship merely to collect bodies to worship at their shrine, and this they regard as healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Many patients, too, consider this strange procedure as salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet at each meeting there is One Who says, “My brother, choose again.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"914#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not forget that any form of specialness must be defended, and will be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The defenseless therapist has the strength of God with him, but the defensive therapist has lost sight of the Source of his salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He does not see and he does not hear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How, then, can he teach?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Because it is the Will of God that he take his place in the plan for salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Because it is the Will of God that his patient be helped to join with him there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Because his inability to see and hear does not limit the Holy Spirit in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Except in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>In time there can be a great lag between the offering and the acceptance of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This is the veil across the face of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"914#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet it can be but an illusion, because time does not exist and the Will of God has always been exactly as it is.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Strictly speaking the
