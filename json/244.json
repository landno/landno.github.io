Adjustment","inlineNumber":"III."},"annotation":"T-20.III","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-20-sect-3\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The belief in sin is an adjustment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And an adjustment is a change; a shift in perception, or a belief that what was so before has been made different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every adjustment is therefore a distortion, and calls upon defenses to uphold it against reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Knowledge requires no adjustments and, in fact, is lost if any shift or change is undertaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For this reduces it at once to mere perception; a way of looking in which certainty is lost and doubt has entered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To this impaired condition <i>are</i> adjustments necessary, because it is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who need adjust to truth, which calls on only what he is, to understand?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Adjustments of any kind are of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it is the ego’s fixed belief that all relationships depend upon adjustments, to make of them what it would have them be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Direct relationships, in which there are no interferences, are always seen as dangerous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego is the self-appointed mediator of all relationships, making whatever adjustments it deems necessary and interposing them between those who would meet, to keep them separate and prevent their union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this studied interference that makes it difficult for you to recognize your holy relationship for what it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy do not interfere with truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are not afraid of it, for it is within the truth they recognize their holiness, and rejoice at what they see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They look on it directly, without attempting to adjust themselves to it, or it to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so they see that it was in them, not deciding first where they would have it be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Their looking merely asks a question, and it is what they see that answers them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You make the world and then adjust to it, and it to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor is there any difference between yourself and it in your perception, which made them both.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A simple question yet remains, and needs an answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do you like what you have made?—a world of murder and attack, through which you thread your timid way through constant dangers, alone and frightened, hoping at most that death will wait a little longer before it overtakes you and you disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span><i>You made this up.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a picture of what you think you are; of how you see yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A murderer <i>is</i> frightened, and those who kill fear death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All these are but the fearful thoughts of those who would adjust themselves to a world made fearful by their adjustments.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And they look out in sorrow from what is sad within, and see the sadness there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Have you not wondered what the world is really like; how it would look through happy eyes?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world you see is but a judgment on yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not there at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet judgment lays a sentence on it, justifies it and makes it real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Such is the world you see; a judgment on yourself, and made by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This sickly picture of yourself is carefully preserved by the ego, whose image it is and which it loves, and placed outside you in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And to this world must you adjust as long as you believe this picture is outside, and has you at its mercy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This world <i>is</i> merciless, and were it outside you, you should indeed be fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet it was you who made it merciless, and now if mercilessness seems to look back at you, it can be corrected.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who in a holy relationship can long remain unholy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world the holy see is one with them, just as the world the ego looks upon is like itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world the holy see is beautiful because they see their innocence in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They did not tell it what it was; they did not make adjustments to fit their orders.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They gently questioned it and whispered, “What are you?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And He Who watches over all perception answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Take not the judgment of the world as answer to the question, “What am I?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The world believes in sin, but the belief that made it as you see it is not outside you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Seek not to make the Son of God adjust to his insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is a stranger in him, who wandered carelessly into the home of truth and who will wander off.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He came without a purpose, but he will not remain before the shining light the Holy Spirit offered, and you accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For there the stranger is made homeless and <i>you</i> are welcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Ask not this transient stranger, “What am I?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is the only thing in all the universe that does not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet it is he you ask, and it is to his answer that you would adjust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This one wild thought, fierce in its arrogance, and yet so tiny and so meaningless it slips unnoticed through the universe of truth, becomes your guide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To it you turn to ask the meaning of the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And of the one blind thing in all the seeing universe of truth you ask, “How shall I look upon the Son of God?”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Does one ask judgment of what is totally bereft of judgment?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And if you have, would you believe the answer, and adjust to it as if it were the truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world you look on is the answer that it gave you, and you have given it power to adjust the world to make its answer true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You asked this puff of madness for the meaning of your unholy relationship, and adjusted it according to its insane answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How happy did it make you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Did you meet your brother with joy to bless the Son of God, and give him thanks for all the happiness that he held out to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Did you recognize your brother as the eternal gift of God to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Did you see the holiness that shone in both you and your brother, to bless the other?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That is the purpose of your holy relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Ask not the means of its attainment of the one thing that still would have it be unholy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Give it no power to adjust the means and end.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Prisoners bound with heavy chains for years, starved and emaciated, weak and exhausted, and with eyes so long cast down in darkness they remember not the light, do not leap up in joy the instant they are made free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It takes a while for them to understand what freedom is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You groped but feebly in the dust and found your brother’s hand, uncertain whether to let it go or to take hold on life so long forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Strengthen your hold and raise your eyes unto your strong companion, in whom the meaning of your freedom lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He seemed to be crucified beside you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And yet his holiness remained untouched and perfect, and with him beside you, you shall this day enter with him to Paradise, and know the peace of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"244#10\"><p

class=\"snr\">3</span>For what is Heaven but union, direct and perfect, and without the veil of fear upon it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here are we one, looking with perfect gentleness upon each other and on ourselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here all thoughts of any separation between us become impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You who were a prisoner in separation are now made free in Paradise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#10:7\"><span

<i>because</i> it knows no sin, and it must look on others as on itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Looking with charity within, what can it fear without?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"244#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The innocent see safety, and the pure in heart see God within His Son, and look unto the Son to lead them to the
