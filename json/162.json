data-sentence-id=\"162#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do you really believe that you can kill the Son of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Father has hidden His Son safely within Himself, and kept him far away from your destructive thoughts, but you know neither the Father nor the Son because of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You attack the real world every day and every hour and every minute, and yet you are surprised that you cannot see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you seek love in order to attack it, you will never find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For if love is sharing, how can you find it except through itself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Offer it and it will come to you, because it is drawn to itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But offer attack and love will remain hidden, for it can live only in peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"162#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s Son is as safe as his Father, for the Son knows his Father’s protection and cannot fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His Father’s Love holds him in perfect peace, and needing nothing, he asks for nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet he is far from you whose Self he is, for you chose to attack him and he disappeared from your sight into his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He did not change, but you did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For a split mind and all its works were not created by the Father, and could not live in the knowledge of Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"162#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you made visible what is not true, what <i>is</i> true became invisible to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it cannot be invisible in itself, for the Holy Spirit sees it with perfect clarity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is invisible to you because you are looking at something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet it is no more up to you to decide what is visible and what is invisible, than it is up to you to decide what reality is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What can be seen is what the Holy Spirit sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The definition of reality is God’s, not yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He created it, and He knows what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You who knew have forgotten, and unless He had given you a way to remember you would have condemned yourself to oblivion.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"162#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Because of your Father’s Love you can never forget Him, for no one can forget what God Himself placed in his memory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can deny it, but you cannot lose it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A Voice will answer every question you ask, and a vision will correct the perception of everything you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For what you have made invisible is the only truth, and what you have not heard is the only Answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God would reunite you with yourself, and did not abandon you in your distress.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are waiting only for Him, and do not know it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet His memory shines in your mind and cannot be obliterated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is no more past than future, being forever always.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"162#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have but to ask for this memory, and you will remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the memory of God cannot shine in a mind that has obliterated it and wants to keep it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the memory of God can dawn only in a mind that chooses to remember, and that has relinquished the insane desire to control reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You who cannot even control yourself should hardly aspire to control the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But look upon what you have made of it, and rejoice that it is not so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"162#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Son of God, be not content with nothing!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What is not real cannot be seen and has no value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God could not offer His Son what has no value, nor could His Son receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You were redeemed the instant you thought you had deserted Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everything you made has never been, and is invisible because the Holy Spirit does not see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet what He does see is yours to behold, and through His vision your perception is healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have made invisible the only truth that this world holds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Valuing nothing, you have sought nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>By making nothing real to you, you have seen it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span><i>But it is not there.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And Christ is invisible to you because of what you have made visible to yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"162#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet it does not matter how much distance you have tried to interpose between your awareness and truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God’s Son can be seen because his vision is shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit looks upon him, and sees nothing else in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is invisible to you is perfect in His sight, and encompasses all of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has remembered you because He forgot not the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You looked upon the unreal and found despair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet by seeking the unreal, what else could you find?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The unreal world <i>is</i> a thing of despair, for it can never be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And you who share God’s Being with Him could never be content without reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What God did not give you has no power over you, and the attraction of love for love remains irresistible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>For it is the function of love to unite all things unto itself, and to hold all things together by extending its wholeness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"162#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The real world was given you by God in loving exchange for the world you made and the world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only take it from the hand of Christ and look upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its reality will make everything else invisible, for beholding it is total perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And as you look upon it you will remember that it was always so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothingness will become invisible, for you will at last have seen truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Redeemed perception is easily translated into knowledge, for only perception is capable of error and perception has never been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Being corrected it gives place to knowledge, which is forever the only reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Atonement is but the way back to what was never lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"162#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your Father could not cease to love His Son.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Do you really believe that you can kill the Son of God?
