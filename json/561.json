data-sentence-id=\"561#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a way of living in the world that is not here, although it seems to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not change appearance, though you smile more frequently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your forehead is serene; your eyes are quiet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And the ones who walk the world as you do recognize their own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet those who have not yet perceived the way will recognize you also, and believe that you are like them, as you were before.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world is an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Those who choose to come to it are seeking for a place where they can be illusions, and avoid their own reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet when they find their own reality is even here, then they step back and let it lead the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What other choice is really theirs to make?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To let illusions walk ahead of truth is madness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But to let illusion sink behind the truth and let the truth stand forth as what it is, is merely sanity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the simple choice we make today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The mad illusion will remain awhile in evidence, for those to look upon who chose to come, and have not yet rejoiced to find they were mistaken in their choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They cannot learn directly from the truth, because they have denied that it is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so they need a Teacher Who perceives their madness, but Who still can look beyond illusion to the simple truth in them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If truth demanded they give up the world, it would appear to them as if it asked the sacrifice of something that is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Many have chosen to renounce the world while still believing its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And they have suffered from a sense of loss, and have not been released accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Others have chosen nothing but the world, and they have suffered from a sense of loss still deeper, which they did not understand.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Between these paths there is another road that leads away from loss of every kind, for sacrifice and deprivation both are quickly left behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the way appointed for you now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You walk this path as others walk, nor do you seem to be distinct from them, although you are indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus can you serve them while you serve yourself, and set their footsteps on the way that God has opened up to you, and them through you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Illusion still appears to cling to you, that you may reach them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it has stepped back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And it is not illusion that they hear you speak of, nor illusion that you bring their eyes to look on and their minds to grasp.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor can the truth, which walks ahead of you, speak to them through illusions, for the road leads past illusion now, while on the way you call to them, that they may follow you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All roads will lead to this one in the end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For sacrifice and deprivation are paths that lead nowhere, choices for defeat, and aims that will remain impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All this steps back as truth comes forth in you, to lead your brothers from the ways of death, and set them on the way to happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Their suffering is but illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet they need a guide to lead them out of it, for they mistake illusion for the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is salvation’s call, and nothing more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It asks that you accept the truth, and let it go before you, lighting up the path of ransom from illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not a ransom with a price.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no cost, but only gain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Illusion can but seem to hold in chains the holy Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is but from illusions he is saved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As they step back, he finds himself again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Walk safely now, yet carefully, because this path is new to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you may find that you are tempted still to walk ahead of truth, and let illusions be your guide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your holy brothers have been given you, to follow in your footsteps as you walk with certainty of purpose to the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It goes before you now, that they may see something with which they can identify; something they understand to lead the way.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet at the journey’s ending there will be no gap, no distance between truth and you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And all illusions walking in the way you travelled will be gone from you as well, with nothing left to keep the truth apart from God’s completion, holy as Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Step back in faith and let truth lead the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You know not where you go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But One Who knows goes with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let Him lead you with the rest.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When dreams are over, time has closed the door on all the things that pass and miracles are purposeless, the holy Son of God will make no journeys.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There will be no wish to be illusion rather than the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And we step forth toward this, as we progress along the way that truth points out to us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is our final journey, which we make for everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We must not lose our way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For as truth goes before us, so it goes before our brothers who will follow us.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We walk to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Pause and reflect on this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Could any way be holier, or more deserving of your effort, of your love and of your full intent?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What way could give you more than everything, or offer less and still content the holy Son of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We walk to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The truth that walks before us now is one with Him, and leads us to where He has always been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What way but this could be a path that you would choose instead?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your feet are safely set upon the road that leads the world to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Look not to ways that seem to lead you elsewhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Dreams are not a worthy guide for you who are God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Forget not He has placed His Hand in yours, and given you your brothers in His trust that you are worthy of His trust in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He cannot be deceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His trust has made your pathway certain and your goal secure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You will not fail your brothers nor your Self.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"561#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And now He asks but that you think of Him a while each day, that He may speak to you and tell you of His Love, reminding you how great His trust; how limitless His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"561#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In your Name and His Own, which are the same, we practice gladly with this thought today:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"561#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I will step back and let Him lead the way, for I would walk along the road to Him.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"There is a way of
