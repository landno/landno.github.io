class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We said before that when a situation has been dedicated wholly to truth, peace is inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its attainment is the criterion by which the wholeness of the dedication can be safely assumed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet we also said that peace without faith will never be attained, for what is dedicated to truth as its only goal is brought to truth <i>by</i> faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This faith encompasses everyone involved, for only thus the situation is perceived as meaningful and as a whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And everyone must be involved in it, or else your faith is limited and your dedication incomplete.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every situation, properly perceived, becomes an opportunity to heal the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And he is healed <i>because</i> you offered faith to him, giving him to the Holy Spirit and releasing him from every demand your ego would make of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus do you see him free, and in this vision does the Holy Spirit share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And since He shares it He has given it, and so He heals through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this joining Him in a united purpose that makes this purpose real, because you make it whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And this <i>is</i> healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The body is healed because you came without it, and joined the Mind in which all healing rests.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body cannot heal, because it cannot make itself sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It <i>needs</i> no healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its health or sickness depends entirely on how the mind perceives it, and the purpose that the mind would use it for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is obvious that a segment of the mind can see itself as separated from the Universal Purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When this occurs the body becomes its weapon, used against this Purpose, to demonstrate the “fact” that separation has occurred.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The body thus becomes the instrument of illusion, acting accordingly; seeing what is not there, hearing what truth has never said and behaving insanely, being imprisoned <i>by</i> insanity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not overlook our earlier statement that faithlessness leads straight to illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For faithlessness is the perception of a brother as a body, and the body cannot be used for purposes of union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If, then, you see your brother as a body, you have established a condition in which uniting with him becomes impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your faithlessness to him has separated you from him, and kept you both apart from being healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your faithlessness has thus opposed the Holy Spirit’s purpose, and brought illusions, centered on the body, to stand between you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And the body will seem to be sick, for you have made of it an “enemy” of healing and the opposite of truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It cannot be difficult to realize that faith must be the opposite of faithlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the difference in how they operate is less apparent, though it follows directly from the fundamental difference in what they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Faithlessness would always limit and attack; faith would remove all limitations and make whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Faithlessness would destroy and separate; faith would unite and heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Faithlessness would interpose illusions between the Son of God and his Creator; faith would remove all obstacles that seem to rise between them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Faithlessness is wholly dedicated to illusions; faith wholly to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Partial dedication is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Truth is the absence of illusion; illusion the absence of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Both cannot be together, nor perceived in the same place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>To dedicate yourself to both is to set up a goal forever impossible to attain, for part of it is sought through the body, thought of as a means for seeking out reality through attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The other part would heal, and therefore calls upon the mind and not the body.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The inevitable compromise is the belief that the body must be healed, and not the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this divided goal has given both an equal reality, which could be possible only if the mind is limited to the body and divided into little parts of seeming wholeness, but without connection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This will not harm the body, but it <i>will</i> keep the delusional thought system in the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here, then, is healing needed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is here that healing <i>is.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For God gave healing not apart from sickness, nor established remedy where sickness cannot be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are together, and when they are seen together, all attempts to keep both truth and illusion in the mind, where both must be, are recognized as dedication to illusion; and given up when brought to truth, and seen as totally unreconcilable with truth, in any respect or in any way.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth and illusion have no connection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This will remain forever true, however much you seek to connect them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But illusions are always connected, as is truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each is united, a complete thought system, but totally disconnected to each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And to perceive this is to recognize where separation is, and where it must be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The result of an idea is never separate from its source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The idea of separation produced the body and remains connected to it, making it sick because of the mind’s identification with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You think you are protecting the body by hiding this connection, for this concealment seems to keep your identification safe from the “attack” of truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you but understood how much this strange concealment has hurt your mind, and how confused your own identification has become because of it!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not see how great the devastation wrought by your faithlessness, for faithlessness is an attack that seems to be justified by its results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For by withholding faith you see what is unworthy of it, and cannot look beyond the barrier to what is joined with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To have faith is to heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the sign that you have accepted the Atonement for yourself, and would therefore share it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By faith, you offer the gift of freedom from the past, which you received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do not use anything your brother has done before to condemn him now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You freely choose to overlook his errors, looking past all barriers between yourself and him, and seeing them as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in that one you see your faith is fully justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no justification for faithlessness, but faith is always justified.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Faith is the opposite of fear, as much a part of love as fear is of attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Faith is the acknowledgment of union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the gracious acknowledgment of everyone as a Son of your most loving Father, loved by Him like you, and therefore loved by you as yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is His Love that joins you and your brother, and for His Love you would keep no one separate from yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each one appears just as he is perceived in the holy instant, united in your purpose to be released from guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You see the Christ in him, and he is healed because you look on what makes faith forever justified in everyone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Faith is the gift of God, through Him Whom God has given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Faithlessness looks upon the Son of God, and judges him unworthy of forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But through the eyes of faith, the Son of God is seen already forgiven, free of all the guilt he laid upon himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Faith sees him only <i>now</i> because it looks not to the past to judge him, but would see in him only what it would see in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It sees not through the body’s eyes, nor looks to bodies for its justification.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is the messenger of the new perception, sent forth to gather witnesses unto its coming, and to return their messages to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Faith is as easily exchanged for knowledge as is the real world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For faith arises from the Holy Spirit’s perception, and is the sign you share it with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Faith is a gift you offer to the Son of God through Him, and wholly acceptable to his Father as to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And therefore offered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your holy relationship, with its new purpose, offers you faith to give unto your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your faithlessness has driven you and him apart, and so you do not recognize salvation in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet faith unites you in the holiness you see, not through the body’s eyes, but in the sight of Him Who joined you, and in Whom you are united.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Grace is not given to a body, but to a mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And the mind that receives it looks instantly beyond the body, and sees the holy place where it was healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is the altar where the grace was given, in which it stands.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do you, then, offer grace and blessing to your brother, for you stand at the same altar where grace was laid for both of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And be you healed by grace together, that you may heal through faith.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the holy instant, you and your brother stand before the altar God has raised unto Himself and both of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Lay faithlessness aside, and come to it together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There will you see the miracle of your relationship as it was made again through faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And there it is that you will realize that there is nothing faith cannot forgive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No error interferes with its calm sight, which brings the miracle of healing with equal ease to all of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For what the messengers of love are sent to do they do, returning the glad tidings that it was done to you and your brother who stand together before the altar from which they were sent forth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As faithlessness will keep your little kingdoms barren and separate, so will faith help the Holy Spirit prepare the ground for the most holy garden that He would make of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For faith brings peace, and so it calls on truth to enter and make lovely what has already been prepared for loveliness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Truth follows faith and peace, completing the process of making lovely that they begin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For faith is still a learning goal, no longer needed when the lesson has been learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet truth will stay forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"229#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let, then, your dedication be to the eternal, and learn how not to interfere with it and make it slave to time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For what you think you do to the eternal you do to <i>you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whom God created as His Son is slave to nothing, being lord of all, along with his Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can enslave a body, but an idea is free, incapable of being kept in prison or limited in any way except by the mind that thought it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"229#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For it remains joined to its source, which is its jailer or its liberator, according to which it chooses as its purpose for itself.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"We said before that when a situation has been dedicated wholly to truth, peace is inevitable.
