<span data-sentence-id=\"607#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Freedom must be impossible as long as you perceive a body as yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The body is a limit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who would seek for freedom in a body looks for it where it can not be found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The mind can be made free when it no longer sees itself as in a body, firmly tied to it and sheltered by its presence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If this were the truth, the mind were vulnerable indeed!</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"607#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The mind that serves the Holy Spirit is unlimited forever, in all ways, beyond the laws of time and space, unbound by any preconceptions, and with strength and power to do whatever it is asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Attack thoughts cannot enter such a mind, because it has been given to the Source of love, and fear can never enter in a mind that has attached itself to love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It rests in God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And who can be afraid who lives in Innocence, and only loves?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"607#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is essential for your progress in this course that you accept today‚Äôs idea, and hold it very dear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be not concerned that to the ego it is quite insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego holds the body dear because it dwells in it, and lives united with the home that it has made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a part of the illusion that has sheltered it from being found illusory itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"607#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here does it hide, and here it can be seen as what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Declare your innocence and you are free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body disappears, because you have no need of it except the need the Holy Spirit sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For this, the body will appear as useful form for what the mind must do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It thus becomes a vehicle which helps forgiveness be extended to the all-inclusive goal that it must reach, according to God‚Äôs plan.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"607#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Cherish today‚Äôs idea, and practice it today and every day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Make it a part of every practice period you take.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no thought that will not gain thereby in power to help the world, and none which will not gain in added gifts to you as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We sound the call of freedom round the world with this idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And would you be exempt from the acceptance of the gifts you give?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"607#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is the home of minds that seek for freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In Him they have found what they have sought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body‚Äôs purpose now is unambiguous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it becomes perfect in the ability to serve an undivided goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In conflict-free and unequivocal response to mind with but the thought of freedom as its goal, the body serves, and serves its purpose well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Without the power to enslave, it is a worthy servant of the freedom which the mind within the Holy Spirit seeks.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"607#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be free today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And carry freedom as your gift to those who still believe they are enslaved within a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Be you free, so that the Holy Spirit can make use of your escape from bondage, to set free the many who perceive themselves as bound and helpless and afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let love replace their fears through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Accept salvation now, and give your mind to Him Who calls to you to make this gift to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For He would give you perfect freedom, perfect joy, and hope that finds its full accomplishment in God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"607#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are God‚Äôs Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In immortality you live forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you not return your mind to this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then practice well the thought the Holy Spirit gives you for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your brothers stand released with you in it; the world is blessed along with you, God‚Äôs Son will weep no more, and Heaven offers thanks for the increase of joy your practice brings even to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"607#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And God Himself extends His Love and happiness each time you say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"607#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I am not a body.</span> <span

mind obeys.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Freedom must be impossible as long as you perceive a body as yourself.
