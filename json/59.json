data-sentence-id=\"059#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your distorted perceptions produce a dense cover over miracle impulses, making it hard for them to reach your own awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The confusion of miracle impulses with physical impulses is a major perceptual distortion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Physical impulses are misdirected miracle impulses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All real pleasure comes from doing God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is because <i>not</i> doing it is a denial of Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Denial of Self results in illusions, while correction of the error brings release from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not deceive yourself into believing that you can relate in peace to God or to your brothers with anything external.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"059#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Child of God, you were created to create the good, the beautiful and the holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not forget this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Love of God, for a little while, must still be expressed through one body to another, because vision is still so dim.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can use your body best to help you enlarge your perception so you can achieve real vision, of which the physical eye is incapable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Learning to do this is the body’s only true usefulness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"059#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Fantasy is a distorted form of vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Fantasies of any kind are distortions, because they always involve twisting perception into unreality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Actions that stem from distortions are literally the reactions of those who know not what they do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fantasy is an attempt to control reality according to false needs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Twist reality in any way and you are perceiving destructively.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Fantasies are a means of making false associations and attempting to obtain pleasure from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But although you can perceive false associations, you can never make them real except to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You believe in what you make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If you offer miracles, you will be equally strong in your belief in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The strength of your conviction will then sustain the belief of the miracle receiver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Fantasies become totally unnecessary as the wholly satisfying nature of reality becomes apparent to both giver and receiver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Reality is “lost” through usurpation, which produces tyranny.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>As long as a single “slave” remains to walk the earth, your release is not complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#3:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>Complete restoration of the Sonship is the only goal of the miracle-minded.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"059#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is a course in mind training.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All learning involves attention and study at some level.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Some of the later parts of the course rest too heavily on these earlier sections not to require their careful study.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will also need them for preparation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Without this, you may become much too fearful of what is to come to make constructive use of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>However, as you study these earlier sections, you will begin to see some of the implications that will be amplified later on.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"059#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A solid foundation is necessary because of the confusion between fear and awe to which I have already referred, and which is often made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I have said that awe is inappropriate in connection with the Sons of God, because you should not experience awe in the presence of your equals.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>However, it was also emphasized that awe is proper in the Presence of your Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I have been careful to clarify my role in the Atonement without either over- or understating it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I am also trying to do the same with yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I have stressed that awe is not an appropriate reaction to me because of our inherent equality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Some of the later steps in this course, however, involve a more direct approach to God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It would be unwise to start on these steps without careful preparation, or awe will be confused with fear, and the experience will be more traumatic than beatific.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Healing is of God in the end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The means are being carefully explained to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"059#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Revelation may occasionally reveal the end to you, but to reach it the means are needed.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Your distorted perceptions produce a dense cover over miracle impulses, making it hard
