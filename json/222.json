<span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant is the result of your determination to be holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the <i>answer.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The desire and the willingness to let it come precede its coming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You prepare your mind for it only to the extent of recognizing that you want it above all else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not necessary that you do more; indeed, it is necessary that you realize that you cannot do more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not attempt to give the Holy Spirit what He does not ask, or you will add the ego to Him and confuse the two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He asks but little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is He Who adds the greatness and the might.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He joins with you to make the holy instant far greater than you can understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is your realization that you need do so little that enables Him to give so much.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"222#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#2:1\"><span class=\"snr

class=\"snr\">3</span>But trust implicitly your willingness, whatever else may enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Concentrate only on this, and be not disturbed that shadows surround it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is why you came.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you could come without them you would not need the holy instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Come to it not in arrogance, assuming that you must achieve the state its coming brings with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The miracle of the holy instant lies in your willingness to let it be what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And in your willingness for this lies also your acceptance of yourself as you were meant to be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"222#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Humility will never ask that you remain content with littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But it does require that you be not content with less than greatness that comes not of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your difficulty with the holy instant arises from your fixed conviction that you are not worthy of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what is this but the determination to be as you would make yourself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God did not create His dwelling place unworthy of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if you believe He cannot enter where He wills to be, you must be interfering with His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You do not need the strength of willingness to come from you, but only from His Will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"222#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant does not come from your little willingness alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is always the result of your small willingness combined with the unlimited power of God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have been wrong in thinking that it is needful to prepare yourself for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is impossible to make arrogant preparations for holiness, and not believe that it is up to you to establish the conditions for peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God has established them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They do not wait upon your willingness for what they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your willingness is needed only to make it possible to teach you what they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you maintain you are unworthy of learning this, you are interfering with the lesson by believing that you must make the learner different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You did not make the learner, nor can you make him different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Would you first make a miracle yourself, and then expect one to be made <i>for</i> you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"222#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You merely ask the question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The answer is given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Seek not to answer, but merely to receive the answer as it is given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In preparing for the holy instant, do not attempt to make yourself holy to be ready to receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is but to confuse your role with God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Atonement cannot come to those who think that they must first atone, but only to those who offer it nothing more than simple willingness to make way for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Purification is of God alone, and therefore for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Rather than seek to prepare yourself for Him, try to think thus:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I who am host to God am worthy of Him.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He Who established His dwelling place in me created it as He would have it be.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It is not needful that I make it ready for Him, but only that I do not interfere with His plan to restore to me my own awareness of my readiness, which is eternal.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>I need add nothing to His plan.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>But to receive it, I must be willing not to substitute my own in place of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"222#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And that is all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Add more, and you will merely take away the little that is asked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember you made guilt, and that your plan for the escape from guilt has been to bring Atonement to it, and make salvation fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it is only fear that you will add, if you prepare yourself for love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The preparation for the holy instant belongs to Him Who gives it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Release yourself to Him Whose function is release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not assume His function for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Give Him but what He asks, that you may learn how little is your part, and how great is His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"222#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is this that makes the holy instant so easy and so natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You make it difficult, because you insist there must be more that you need do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You find it difficult to accept the idea that you need give so little, to receive so much.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And it is very hard for you to realize it is not personally insulting that your contribution and the Holy Spirit’s are so extremely disproportionate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are still convinced that your understanding is a powerful contribution to the truth, and makes it what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet we have emphasized that you need understand nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Salvation is easy just <i>because</i> it asks nothing you cannot give right now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"222#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forget not that it has been your decision to make everything that is natural and easy for you impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you believe the holy instant is difficult for you, it is because you have become the arbiter of what is possible, and remain unwilling to give place to One Who knows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The whole belief in orders of difficulty in miracles is centered on this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everything God wills is not only possible, but has already happened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And that is why the past has gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It never happened in reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"222#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only in your mind, which thought it did, is its undoing needful.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The holy instant is the result of
