class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Although you are one Self, you experience yourself as two; as both good and evil, loving and hating, mind and body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This sense of being split into opposites induces feelings of acute and constant conflict, and leads to frantic attempts to reconcile the contradictory aspects of this self-perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have sought many such solutions, and none of them has worked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The opposites you see in you will never be compatible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But one exists.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The fact that truth and illusion cannot be reconciled, no matter how you try, what means you use and where you see the problem, must be accepted if you would be saved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Until you have accepted this, you will attempt an endless list of goals you cannot reach; a senseless series of expenditures of time and effort, hopefulness and doubt, each one as futile as the one before, and failing as the next one surely will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Problems that have no meaning cannot be resolved within the framework they are set.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Two selves in conflict could not be resolved, and good and evil have no meeting place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The self you made can never be your Self, nor can your Self be split in two, and still be what It is and must forever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A mind and body cannot both exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Make no attempt to reconcile the two, for one denies the other can be real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you are physical, your mind is gone from your self-concept, for it has no place in which it could be really part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you are spirit, then the body must be meaningless to your reality.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Spirit makes use of mind as means to find its Self expression.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And the mind which serves the spirit is at peace and filled with joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its power comes from spirit, and it is fulfilling happily its function here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet mind can also see itself divorced from spirit, and perceive itself within a body it confuses with itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Without its function then it has no peace, and happiness is alien to its thoughts.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet mind apart from spirit cannot think.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has denied its Source of strength, and sees itself as helpless, limited and weak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Dissociated from its function now, it thinks it is alone and separate, attacked by armies massed against itself and hiding in the body’s frail support.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now must it reconcile unlike with like, for this is what it thinks that it is for.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Waste no more time on this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Who can resolve the senseless conflicts which a dream presents?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What could the resolution mean in truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What purpose could it serve?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is it for?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Salvation cannot make illusions real, nor solve a problem that does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Perhaps you hope it can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet would you have God’s plan for the release of His dear Son bring pain to him, and fail to set him free?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your Self retains Its Thoughts, and they remain within your mind and in the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit holds salvation in your mind, and offers it the way to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Salvation is a thought you share with God, because His Voice accepted it for you and answered in your name that it was done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus is salvation kept among the Thoughts your Self holds dear and cherishes for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will attempt today to find this thought, whose presence in your mind is guaranteed by Him Who speaks to you from your one Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Our hourly five-minute practicing will be a search for Him within your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Salvation comes from this one Self through Him Who is the Bridge between your mind and It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Wait patiently, and let Him speak to you about your Self, and what your mind can do, restored to It and free to serve Its Will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begin with saying this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"500#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Salvation comes from my one Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its Thoughts are mine to use.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"500#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then seek Its Thoughts, and claim them as your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>These are your own real thoughts you have denied, and let your mind go wandering in a world of dreams, to find illusions in their place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here are your thoughts, the only ones you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Salvation is among them; find it there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you succeed, the thoughts that come to you will tell you you are saved, and that your mind has found the function that it sought to lose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your Self will welcome it and give it peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Restored in strength, it will again flow out from spirit to the spirit in all things created by the Spirit as Itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your mind will bless all things.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Confusion done, you are restored, for you have found your Self.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your Self knows that you cannot fail today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps your mind remains uncertain yet a little while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Be not dismayed by this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The joy your Self experiences It will save for you, and it will yet be yours in full awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Every time you spend five minutes of the hour seeking Him Who joins your mind and Self, you offer Him another treasure to be kept for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"500#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Each time today you tell your frantic mind salvation comes from your one Self, you lay another treasure in your growing store.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And all of it is given everyone who asks for it, and will accept the gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"500#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Think, then, how much is given unto you to give this day, that it be given you!</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Although you are one Self, you experience yourself as two;
