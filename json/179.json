data-sentence-id=\"179#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit needs a happy learner, in whom His mission can be happily accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You who are steadfastly devoted to misery must first recognize that you are miserable and not happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit cannot teach without this contrast, for you believe that misery <i>is</i> happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This has so confused you that you have undertaken to learn to do what you can never do, believing that unless you learn it you will not be happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not realize that the foundation on which this most peculiar learning goal depends means absolutely nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it may still make sense to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Have faith in nothing and you will find the “treasure” that you seek.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet you will add another burden to your already burdened mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You will believe that nothing is of value, and will value it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>A little piece of glass, a speck of dust, a body or a war are one to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>For if you value one thing made of nothing, you have believed that nothing can be precious, and that you <i>can</i> learn how to make the untrue true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"179#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit, seeing where you are but knowing you are elsewhere, begins His lesson in simplicity with the fundamental teaching that <i>truth is true</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the hardest lesson you will ever learn, and in the end the only one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Simplicity is very difficult for twisted minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Consider all the distortions you have made of nothing; all the strange forms and feelings and actions and reactions that you have woven out of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothing is so alien to you as the simple truth, and nothing are you less inclined to listen to.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The contrast between what is true and what is not is perfectly apparent, yet you do not see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The simple and the obvious are not apparent to those who would make palaces and royal robes of nothing, believing they are kings with golden crowns because of them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"179#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All this the Holy Spirit sees, and teaches, simply, that all this is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To those unhappy learners who would teach themselves nothing, and delude themselves into believing that it is not nothing, the Holy Spirit says, with steadfast quietness:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"179#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The truth is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing else matters, nothing else is real, and everything beside it is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let Me make the one distinction for you that you cannot make, but need to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your faith in nothing is deceiving you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Offer your faith to Me, and I will place it gently in the holy place where it belongs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You will find no deception there, but only the simple truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And you will love it because you will understand it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"179#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Like you, the Holy Spirit did not make truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Like God, He knows it to be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He brings the light of truth into the darkness, and lets it shine on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And as it shines your brothers see it, and realizing that this light is not what you have made, they see in you more than you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They will be happy learners of the lesson this light brings to them, because it teaches them release from nothing and from all the works of nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The heavy chains that seem to bind them to despair they do not see as nothing, until you bring the light to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And then they see the chains have disappeared, and so they <i>must</i> have been nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you will see it with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Because you taught them gladness and release, they will become your teachers in release and gladness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"179#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you teach anyone that truth is true, you learn it with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so you learn that what seemed hardest was the easiest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Learn to be a happy learner.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will never learn how to make nothing everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet see that this has been your goal, and recognize how foolish it has been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Be glad it is undone, for when you look at it in simple honesty, it <i>is</i> undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I said before, “Be not content with nothing,” for you have believed that nothing could content you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span><i>It is not so.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"179#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you would be a happy learner, you must give everything you have learned to the Holy Spirit, to be unlearned for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And then begin to learn the joyous lessons that come quickly on the firm foundation that truth is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what is builded there <i>is</i> true, and built on truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The universe of learning will open up before you in all its gracious simplicity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>With truth before you, you will not look back.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"179#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The happy learner meets the conditions of learning here, as he meets the conditions of knowledge in the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All this lies in the Holy Spirit’s plan to free you from the past, and open up the way to freedom for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For truth <i>is</i> true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What else could ever be, or ever was?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This simple lesson holds the key to the dark door that you believe is locked forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You made this door of nothing, and behind it <i>is</i> nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The key is only the light that shines away the shapes and forms and fears of nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Accept this key to freedom from the hands of Christ Who gives it to you, that you may join Him in the holy task of bringing light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For, like your brothers, you do not realize the light has come and freed you from the sleep of darkness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"179#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Behold your brothers in their freedom, and learn of them how to be free of darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The light in you will waken them, and they will not leave you asleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The vision of Christ is given the very instant that it is perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where everything is clear, it is all holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The quietness of its simplicity is so compelling that you will realize it is impossible to deny the simple truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For there is nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God is everywhere, and His Son is in Him with everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"179#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can he sing the dirge of sorrow when this is true?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The Holy Spirit needs a happy learner, in whom His mission can be happily accomplished.
