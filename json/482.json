will still have the problem, because you will not recognize that it has been solved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the situation of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The problem of separation, which is really the only problem, has already been solved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the solution is not recognized because the problem is not recognized.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"482#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone in this world seems to have his own special problems.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet they are all the same, and must be recognized as one if the one solution that solves them all is to be accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who can see that a problem has been solved if he thinks the problem is something else?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Even if he is given the answer, he cannot see its relevance.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"482#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That is the position in which you find yourself now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have the answer, but you are still uncertain about what the problem is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A long series of different problems seems to confront you, and as one is settled the next one and the next arise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There seems to be no end to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no time in which you feel completely free of problems and at peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"482#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The temptation to regard problems as many is the temptation to keep the problem of separation unsolved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world seems to present you with a vast number of problems, each requiring a different answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This perception places you in a position in which your problem solving must be inadequate, and failure is inevitable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"482#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one could solve all the problems the world appears to hold.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They seem to be on so many levels, in such varying forms and with such varied content, that they confront you with an impossible situation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Dismay and depression are inevitable as you regard them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Some spring up unexpectedly, just as you think you have resolved the previous ones.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Others remain unsolved under a cloud of denial, and rise to haunt you from time to time, only to be hidden again but still unsolved.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"482#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All this complexity is but a desperate attempt not to recognize the problem, and therefore not to let it be resolved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you could recognize that your only problem is separation, no matter what form it takes, you could accept the answer because you would see its relevance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Perceiving the underlying constancy in all the problems that seem to confront you, you would understand that you have the means to solve them all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you would use the means, because you recognize the problem.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"482#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In our longer practice periods today we will ask what the problem is, and what is the answer to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will not assume that we already know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will try to free our minds of all the many different kinds of problems we think we have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We will try to realize that we have only one problem, which we have failed to recognize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We will ask what it is, and wait for the answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We will be told.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Then we will ask for the solution to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And we will be told.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"482#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The exercises for today will be successful to the extent to which you do not insist on defining the problem.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you will not succeed in letting all your preconceived notions go, but that is not necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All that is necessary is to entertain some doubt about the reality of your version of what your problems are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are trying to recognize that you have been given the answer by recognizing the problem, so that the problem and the answer can be brought together and you can be at peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"482#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The shorter practice periods for today will not be set by time, but by need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will see many problems today, each one calling for an answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Our efforts will be directed toward recognizing that there is only one problem and one answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In this recognition are all problems resolved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In this recognition there is peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"482#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be not deceived by the form of problems today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Whenever any difficulty seems to rise, tell yourself quickly:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"482#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let me recognize this problem so it can be solved.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"482#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then try to suspend all judgment about what the problem is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If possible, close your eyes for a moment and ask what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"482#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You will be heard and you will be answered.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"A problem cannot be solved if you do not know what it is.
