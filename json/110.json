data-sentence-id=\"110#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth can only <i>be</i> recognized and <i>need</i> only be recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Inspiration is of the Holy Spirit, and certainty is of God according to His laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Both, therefore, come from the same Source, since inspiration comes from the Voice for God and certainty comes from the laws of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Healing does not come directly from God, Who knows His creations as perfectly whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet healing is still of God, because it proceeds from His Voice and from His laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is their result, in a state of mind that does not know Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The state is unknown to Him and therefore does not exist, but those who sleep are unaware.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Because they are unaware, they do not know.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"110#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit must work <i>through</i> you to teach you He is <i>in</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is an intermediary step toward the knowledge that you are in God because you are part of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The miracles the Holy Spirit inspires can have no order of difficulty, because every part of creation is of one order.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is God’s Will and yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The laws of God establish this, and the Holy Spirit reminds you of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you heal, you are remembering the laws of God and forgetting the laws of the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I said before that forgetting is merely a way of remembering better.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is therefore not the opposite of remembering when it is properly perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Perceived improperly, it induces a perception of conflict with something else, as all incorrect perception does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Properly perceived, it can be used as a way out of conflict, as all proper perception can.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"110#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego does not want to teach everyone all it has learned, because that would defeat its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore it does not really learn at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit teaches you to use what the ego has made, to teach the opposite of what the ego has “learned.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The kind of learning is as irrelevant as is the particular ability that was applied to the learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All you need do is make the effort to learn, for the Holy Spirit has a unified goal for the effort.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If different abilities are applied long enough to one goal, the abilities themselves become unified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is because they are channelized in one direction, or in one way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Ultimately, then, they all contribute to one result, and by so doing, their similarity rather than their differences is emphasized.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"110#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All abilities should therefore be given over to the Holy Spirit, Who understands how to use them properly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He uses them only for healing, because He knows you only as whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By healing you learn of wholeness, and by learning of wholeness you learn to remember God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have forgotten Him, but the Holy Spirit understands that your forgetting must be translated into a way of remembering.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"110#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s goal is as unified as the Holy Spirit’s, and it is because of this that their goals can never be reconciled in any way or to any extent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego always seeks to divide and separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit always seeks to unify and heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As you heal you are healed, because the Holy Spirit sees no order of difficulty in healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Healing is the way to undo the belief in differences, being the only way of perceiving the Sonship as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This perception is therefore in accord with the laws of God, even in a state of mind that is out of accord with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The strength of right perception is so great that it brings the mind into accord with His, because it serves His Voice, which is in all of you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"110#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To think you can oppose the Will of God is a real delusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego believes that it can, and that it can offer you its own “will” as a gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span><i>You do not want it.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not a gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is nothing at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God has given you a gift that you both <i>have</i> and <i>are.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When you do not use it, you forget that you have it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>By not remembering it, you do not know what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Healing, then, is a way of approaching knowledge by thinking in accordance with the laws of God, and recognizing their universality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Without this recognition, you have made the laws meaningless to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet the laws are not meaningless, since all meaning is contained by them and in them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"110#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Seek ye first the Kingdom of Heaven, because that is where the laws of God operate truly, and they can operate only truly because they are the laws of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But seek this only, because you can find nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There <i>is</i> nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God is All in all in a very literal sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All being is in Him Who is all Being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are therefore in Him since your being is His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Healing is a way of forgetting the sense of danger the ego has induced in you, by not recognizing its existence in your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This strengthens the Holy Spirit in both of you, because it is a refusal to acknowledge fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Love needs only this invitation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It comes freely to all the Sonship, being what the Sonship is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>By your awakening to it, you are merely forgetting what you are not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"110#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>This enables you to remember what you are.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Truth can only be recognized and need only be recognized.
