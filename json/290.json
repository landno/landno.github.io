data-sentence-id=\"290#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The grace of God rests gently on forgiving eyes, and everything they look on speaks of Him to the beholder.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He can see no evil; nothing in the world to fear, and no one who is different from himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And as he loves them, so he looks upon himself with love and gentleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He would no more condemn himself for his mistakes than damn another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is not an arbiter of vengeance, nor a punisher of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The kindness of his sight rests on himself with all the tenderness it offers others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For he would only heal and only bless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And being in accord with what God wills, he has the power to heal and bless all those he looks on with the grace of God upon his sight.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"290#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Eyes become used to darkness, and the light of brilliant day seems painful to the eyes grown long accustomed to the dim effects perceived at twilight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And they turn away from sunlight and the clarity it brings to what they look upon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Dimness seems better; easier to see, and better recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Somehow the vague and more obscure seems easier to look upon; less painful to the eyes than what is wholly clear and unambiguous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet this is not what eyes are for, and who can say that he prefers the darkness and maintain he wants to see?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"290#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The wish to see calls down the grace of God upon your eyes, and brings the gift of light that makes sight possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you behold your brother?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God is glad to have you look on him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He does not will your savior be unrecognized by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor does He will that he remain without the function that He gave to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let him no more be lonely, for the lonely ones are those who see no function in the world for them to fill; no place where they are needed, and no aim which only they can perfectly fulfill.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"290#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is the Holy Spirit’s kind perception of specialness; His use of what you made, to heal instead of harm.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To each He gives a special function in salvation he alone can fill; a part for only him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor is the plan complete until he finds his special function, and fulfills the part assigned to him, to make himself complete within a world where incompletion rules.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"290#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here, where the laws of God do not prevail in perfect form, can he yet do <i>one</i> perfect thing and make <i>one</i> perfect choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And by this act of special faithfulness to one perceived as other than himself, he learns the gift was given to himself, and so they must be one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiveness is the only function meaningful in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the means the Holy Spirit uses to translate specialness from sin into salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forgiveness is for all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But when it rests on all it is complete, and every function of this world completed with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Then is time no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet while in time, there is still much to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And each must do what is allotted him, for on his part does all the plan depend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He <i>has</i> a special part in time for so he chose, and choosing it, he made it for himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>His wish was not denied but changed in form, to let it serve his brother and himself, and thus become a means to save instead of lose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"290#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation is no more than a reminder this world is not your home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its laws are not imposed on you, its values are not yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And nothing that you think you see in it is really there at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is seen and understood as each one takes his part in its undoing, as he did in making it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He has the means for either, as he always did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The specialness he chose to hurt himself did God appoint to be the means for his salvation, from the very instant that the choice was made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His special sin was made his special grace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>His special hate became his special love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"290#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit needs your special function, that His may be fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Think not you lack a special value here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You wanted it, and it is given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All that you made can serve salvation easily and well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Son of God can make no choice the Holy Spirit cannot employ on his behalf, and not against himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only in darkness does your specialness appear to be attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In light, you see it as your special function in the plan to save the Son of God from all attack, and let him understand that he is safe, as he has always been, and will remain in time and in eternity alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is the function given you for your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Take it gently, then, from your brother’s hand, and let salvation be perfectly fulfilled in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"290#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Do this <i>one</i> thing, that everything be given you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The grace of God rests gently on forgiving
