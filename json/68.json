data-sentence-id=\"068#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may still complain about fear, but you nevertheless persist in making yourself fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I have already indicated that you cannot ask me to release you from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I know it does not exist, but you do not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If I intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a basic law of cause and effect; the most fundamental law there is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I would hardly help you if I depreciated the power of your own thinking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This would be in direct opposition to the purpose of this course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is much more helpful to remind you that you do not guard your thoughts carefully enough.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You may feel that at this point it would take a miracle to enable you to do this, which is perfectly true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You are not used to miracle-minded thinking, but you can be trained to think that way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>All miracle workers need that kind of training.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"068#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I cannot let you leave your mind unguarded, or you will not be able to help me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Miracle working entails a full realization of the power of thought in order to avoid miscreation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Otherwise a miracle will be necessary to set the mind itself straight, a circular process that would not foster the time collapse for which the miracle was intended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle worker must have genuine respect for true cause and effect as a necessary condition for the miracle to occur.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"068#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Both miracles and fear come from thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you are not free to choose one, you would also not be free to choose the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By choosing the miracle you <i>have</i> rejected fear, if only temporarily.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have been fearful of everyone and everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are afraid of God, of me and of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have misperceived or miscreated Us, and believe in what you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You would not have done this if you were not afraid of your own thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The fearful <i>must</i> miscreate, because they misperceive creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>When you miscreate you are in pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The cause and effect principle now becomes a real expediter, though only temporarily.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Actually, “Cause” is a term properly belonging to God, and His “Effect” is His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>This entails a set of Cause and Effect relationships totally different from those you introduce into miscreation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>The fundamental conflict in this world, then, is between creation and miscreation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>All fear is implicit in the second, and all love in the first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#3:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>The conflict is therefore one between love and fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"068#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It has already been said that you believe you cannot control fear because you yourself made it, and your belief in it seems to render it out of your control.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet any attempt to resolve the error through attempting the mastery of fear is useless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In fact, it asserts the power of fear by the very assumption that it need be mastered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The true resolution rests entirely on mastery through love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In the interim, however, the sense of conflict is inevitable, since you have placed yourself in a position where you believe in the power of what does not exist.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"068#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing and everything cannot coexist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To believe in one is to deny the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fear is really nothing and love is everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whenever light enters darkness, the darkness is abolished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you believe is true for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In this sense the separation <i>has</i> occurred, and to deny it is merely to use denial inappropriately.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>However, to concentrate on error is only a further error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The initial corrective procedure is to recognize temporarily that there is a problem, but only as an indication that immediate correction is needed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This establishes a state of mind in which the Atonement can be accepted without delay.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It should be emphasized, however, that ultimately no compromise is possible between everything and nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Time is essentially a device by which all compromise in this respect can be given up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>It only seems to be abolished by degrees, because time itself involves intervals that do not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Miscreation made this necessary as a corrective device.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#5:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>The statement “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life” needs only one slight correction to be meaningful in this context; “He gave it <i>to</i> His only begotten Son.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"068#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It should especially be noted that God has only <i>one</i> Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If all His creations are His Sons, every one must be an integral part of the whole Sonship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Sonship in its Oneness transcends the sum of its parts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>However, this is obscured as long as any of its parts is missing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is why the conflict cannot ultimately be resolved until all the parts of the Sonship have returned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only then can the meaning of wholeness in the true sense be understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Any part of the Sonship can believe in error or incompleteness if he so chooses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>However, if he does so, he is believing in the existence of nothingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The correction of this error is the Atonement.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"068#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have already briefly spoken about readiness, but some additional points might be helpful here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Readiness is only the prerequisite for accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The two should not be confused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As soon as a state of readiness occurs, there is usually some degree of desire to accomplish, but it is by no means necessarily undivided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The state does not imply more than a potential for a change of mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Confidence cannot develop fully until mastery has been accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>We have already attempted to correct the fundamental error that fear can be mastered, and have emphasized that the only real mastery is through love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Readiness is only the beginning of confidence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"068#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You may think this implies that an enormous amount of time is necessary between readiness and mastery, but let me remind you that time and space are under my control.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You may still complain about fear, but you nevertheless
