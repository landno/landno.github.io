data-sentence-id=\"181#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you accept a brother’s guiltlessness you will see the Atonement in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For by proclaiming it in him you make it yours, and you will see what you sought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will not see the symbol of your brother’s guiltlessness shining within him while you still believe it is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His guiltlessness is <i>your</i> Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Grant it to him, and you will see the truth of what you have acknowledged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet truth is offered first to be received, even as God gave it first to His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The first in time means nothing, but the First in eternity is God the Father, Who is both First and One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Beyond the First there is no other, for there is no order, no second or third, and nothing but the First.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"181#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who belong to the First Cause, created by Him like unto Himself and part of Him, are more than merely guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The state of guiltlessness is only the condition in which what is not there has been removed from the disordered mind that thought it was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This state, and only this, must you attain, with God beside you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For until you do, you will still think that you are separate from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You can perhaps feel His Presence next to you, but cannot know that you are one with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This cannot be taught.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Learning applies only to the condition in which it happens of itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"181#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have let all that obscured the truth in your most holy mind be undone for you, and therefore stand in grace before your Father, He will give Himself to you as He has always done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Giving Himself is all He knows, and so it is all knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what He knows not cannot be, and therefore cannot be given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Ask not to be forgiven, for this has already been accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Ask, rather, to learn how to forgive, and to restore what always was to your unforgiving mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Atonement becomes real and visible to those who use it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>On earth this is your only function, and you must learn that it is all you want to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You will feel guilty till you learn this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For in the end, whatever form it takes, your guilt arises from your failure to fulfill your function in God’s Mind with all of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Can you escape this guilt by failing to fulfill your function here?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"181#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You need not understand creation to do what must be done before that knowledge would be meaningful to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God breaks no barriers; neither did He make them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you release them they are gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God will not fail, nor ever has in anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Decide that God is right and you are wrong about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He created you out of Himself, but still within Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He knows what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Remember that there is no second to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There cannot, therefore, be anyone without His Holiness, nor anyone unworthy of His perfect Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Fail not in your function of loving in a loveless place made out of darkness and deceit, for thus are darkness and deceit undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Fail not yourself, but instead offer to God and you His blameless Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>For this small gift of appreciation for His Love, God will Himself exchange your gift for His.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"181#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Before you make any decisions for yourself, remember that you have decided against your function in Heaven, and then consider carefully whether you want to make decisions here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your function here is only to decide against deciding what you want, in recognition that you do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How, then, can you decide what you should do?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Leave all decisions to the One Who speaks for God, and for your function as He knows it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>So will He teach you to remove the awful burden you have laid upon yourself by loving not the Son of God, and trying to teach him guilt instead of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Give up this frantic and insane attempt that cheats you of the joy of living with your God and Father, and of waking gladly to His Love and Holiness that join together as the truth in you, making you one with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"181#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have learned how to decide with God, all decisions become as easy and as right as breathing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no effort, and you will be led as gently as if you were being carried down a quiet path in summer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only your own volition seems to make deciding hard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit will not delay in answering your every question what to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He knows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And He will tell you, and then do it for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You who are tired will find this is more restful than sleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For you can bring your guilt into sleeping, but not into this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"181#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Unless you are guiltless you cannot know God, Whose Will is that you know Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore, you <i>must</i> be guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet if you do not accept the necessary conditions for knowing Him, you have denied Him and do not recognize Him, though He is all around you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He cannot be known without His Son, whose guiltlessness is the condition for knowing Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Accepting His Son as guilty is denial of the Father so complete, that knowledge is swept away from recognition in the very mind where God Himself has placed it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you would but listen, and learn how impossible this is!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not endow Him with attributes you understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You made Him not, and anything you understand is not of Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"181#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your task is not to make reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is here without your making, but not without you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You who have tried to throw yourself away and valued God so little, hear me speak for Him and for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot understand how much your Father loves you, for there is no parallel in your experience of the world to help you understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is nothing on earth with which it can compare, and nothing you have ever felt apart from Him resembles it ever so faintly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot even give a blessing in perfect gentleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Would you know of One Who gives forever, and Who knows of nothing except giving?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"181#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The children of Heaven live in the light of the blessing of their Father, because they know that they are sinless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Atonement was established as the means of restoring guiltlessness to minds that have denied it, and thus denied Heaven to themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Atonement teaches you the true condition of the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not teach you what you are, or what your Father is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit, Who remembers this for you, merely teaches you how to remove the blocks that stand between you and what you know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His memory is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you remember what you have made, you are remembering nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Remembrance of reality is in Him, and therefore in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"181#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The guiltless and the guilty are totally incapable of understanding one another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each perceives the other as like himself, making both unable to communicate, because each sees the other unlike the way he sees himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God can communicate only to the Holy Spirit in your mind, because only He shares the knowledge of what you are with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And only the Holy Spirit can answer God for you, for only He knows what God is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everything else that you have placed within your mind cannot exist, for what is not in communication with the Mind of God has never been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Communication with God is life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"181#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing without it is at all.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"When you accept a brother’s guiltlessness you will see the Atonement in him.
