class=\"snr\">2</span>His awareness is in everyone’s memory, and His Word is written on everyone’s heart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet this awareness and this memory can arise across the threshold of recognition only where all barriers to truth have been removed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In how many is this the case?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here, then, is the role of God’s teachers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They, too, have not attained the necessary understanding as yet, but they have joined with others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is what sets them apart from the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And it is this that enables others to leave the world with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Alone they are nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But in their joining is the power of God.</span></p></div> <div

retaining no trace of worldly limits and remembering their own Identity perfectly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These might be called the Teachers of teachers because, although they are no longer visible, their image can yet be called upon.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And they will appear when and where it is helpful for them to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To those to whom such appearances would be frightening, they give their ideas.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one can call on them in vain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nor is there anyone of whom they are unaware.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All needs are known to them, and all mistakes are recognized and overlooked by them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The time will come when this is understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And meanwhile, they give all their gifts to the teachers of God who look to them for help, asking all things in their name and in no other.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"841#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sometimes a teacher of God may have a brief experience of direct union with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this world, it is almost impossible that this endure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It can, perhaps, be won after much devotion and dedication, and then be maintained for much of the time on earth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But this is so rare that it cannot be considered a realistic goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If it happens, so be it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If it does not happen, so be it as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All worldly states must be illusory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If God were reached directly in sustained awareness, the body would not be long maintained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Those who have laid the body down merely to extend their helpfulness to those remaining behind are few indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And they need helpers who are still in bondage and still asleep, so that by their awakening can God’s Voice be heard.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"841#4\"><p

data-sentence-id=\"841#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is your function to escape from them, but not to be without them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you would be heard by those who suffer, you must speak their language.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you would be a savior, you must understand what needs to be escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Salvation is not theoretical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Behold the problem, ask for the answer, and then accept it when it comes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nor will its coming be long delayed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All the help you can accept will be provided, and not one need you have will not be met.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let us not, then, be too concerned with goals for which you are not ready.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>God takes you where you are and welcomes you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"841#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>What more could you desire, when this is all you need?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"God indeed can be
