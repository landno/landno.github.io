data-sentence-id=\"216#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The substitutes for aspects of the situation are the witnesses to your lack of faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They demonstrate that you did not believe the situation and the problem were in the same place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The problem <i>was</i> the lack of faith, and it is this you demonstrate when you remove it from its source and place it elsewhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As a result, you do not see the problem.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Had you not lacked faith that it could be solved, the problem would be gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And the situation would have been meaningful to you, because the interference in the way of understanding would have been removed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To remove the problem elsewhere is to keep it, for you remove yourself from it and make it unsolvable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"216#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no problem in any situation that faith will not solve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no shift in any aspect of the problem but will make solution impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For if you shift part of the problem elsewhere the meaning of the problem must be lost, and the solution to the problem is inherent in its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is it not possible that all your problems have been solved, but you have removed yourself from the solution?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet faith must be where something has been done, and where you see it done.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"216#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A situation is a relationship, being the joining of thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If problems are perceived, it is because the thoughts are judged to be in conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But if the goal is truth, this is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Some idea of bodies must have entered, for minds cannot attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The thought of bodies is the sign of faithlessness, for bodies cannot solve anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is their intrusion on the relationship, an error in your thoughts about the situation, which then becomes the justification for your lack of faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You will make this error, but be not at all concerned with that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The error does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Faithlessness brought to faith will never interfere with truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But faithlessness used <i>against</i> truth will always destroy faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>If you lack faith, ask that it be restored where it was lost, and seek not to have it made up to you elsewhere, as if you had been unjustly deprived of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"216#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only what <i>you</i> have not given can be lacking in any situation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But remember this; the goal of holiness was set for your relationship, and not by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You did not set it because holiness cannot be seen except through faith, and your relationship was not holy because your faith in your brother was so limited and little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your faith must grow to meet the goal that has been set.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The goal’s reality will call this forth, for you will see that peace and faith will not come separately.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What situation can you be in without faith, and remain faithful to your brother?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"216#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every situation in which you find yourself is but a means to meet the purpose set for your relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>See it as something else and you are faithless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Use not your faithlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let it enter and look upon it calmly, but do not use it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Faithlessness is the servant of illusion, and wholly faithful to its master.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Use it, and it will carry you straight to illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Be tempted not by what it offers you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It interferes, not with the goal, but with the value of the goal to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Accept not the illusion of peace it offers, but look upon its offering and recognize it <i>is</i> illusion.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"216#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The goal of illusion is as closely tied to faithlessness as faith to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you lack faith in anyone to fulfill, and perfectly, his part in any situation dedicated in advance to truth, your dedication is divided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so you have been faithless to your brother, and used your faithlessness against him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No relationship is holy unless its holiness goes with it everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As holiness and faith go hand in hand, so must its faith go everywhere with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The goal’s reality will call forth and accomplish every miracle needed for its fulfillment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing too small or too enormous, too weak or too compelling, but will be gently turned to its use and purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The universe will serve it gladly, as it serves the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But do not interfere.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"216#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The power set in you in whom the Holy Spirit’s goal has been established is so far beyond your little conception of the infinite that you have no idea how great the strength that goes with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you can use <i>this</i> in perfect safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet for all its might, so great it reaches past the stars and to the universe that lies beyond them, your little faithlessness can make it useless, if you would use the faithlessness instead.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"216#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet think on this, and learn the cause of faithlessness: You think you hold against your brother what he has done to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But what you really blame him for is what <i>you</i> did to <i>him.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not his past but yours you hold against him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you lack faith in him because of what you were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you are as innocent of what you were as he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What never was is causeless, and is not there to interfere with truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no cause for faithlessness, but there <i>is</i> Cause for faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>That Cause has entered any situation that shares Its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The light of truth shines from the center of the situation, and touches everyone to whom the situation’s purpose calls.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It calls to everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>There is no situation that does not involve your whole relationship, in every aspect and complete in every part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>You can leave nothing of yourself outside it and keep the situation holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#8:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>For it shares the purpose of your whole relationship, and derives its meaning from it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"216#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Enter each situation with the faith you give your brother, or you are faithless to your own relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your faith will call the others to share your purpose, as the same purpose called forth the faith in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you will see the means you once employed to lead you to illusions transformed to means for truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Truth calls for faith, and faith makes room for truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When the Holy Spirit changed the purpose of your relationship by exchanging yours for His, the goal He placed there was extended to every situation in which you enter, or will ever enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And every situation was thus made free of the past, which would have made it purposeless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"216#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You call for faith because of Him Who walks with you in every situation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are no longer wholly insane, and no longer alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For loneliness in God must be a dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You whose relationship shares the Holy Spirit’s goal are set apart from loneliness because the truth has come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its call for faith is strong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"216#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Use not your faithlessness against it, for it calls you to salvation and to peace.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The substitutes for aspects of the situation are the
