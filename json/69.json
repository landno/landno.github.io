data-sentence-id=\"069#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>One of the ways in which you can correct the magic-miracle confusion is to remember that you did not create yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are apt to forget this when you become egocentric, and this puts you in a position where a belief in magic is virtually inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your will to create was given you by your Creator, Who was expressing the same Will in His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Since creative ability rests in the mind, everything you create is necessarily a matter of will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It also follows that whatever you alone make is real in your own sight, though not in the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This basic distinction leads directly into the real meaning of the Last Judgment.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"069#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Last Judgment is one of the most threatening ideas in your thinking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is because you do not understand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Judgment is not an attribute of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It was brought into being only after the separation, when it became one of the many learning devices to be built into the overall plan.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Just as the separation occurred over millions of years, the Last Judgment will extend over a similarly long period, and perhaps an even longer one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Its length can, however, be greatly shortened by miracles, the device for shortening but not abolishing time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If a sufficient number become truly miracle-minded, this shortening process can be virtually immeasurable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is essential, however, that you free yourself from fear quickly, because you must emerge from the conflict if you are to bring peace to other minds.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"069#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Last Judgment is generally thought of as a procedure undertaken by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Actually it will be undertaken by my brothers with my help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a final healing rather than a meting out of punishment, however much you may think that punishment is deserved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Punishment is a concept totally opposed to right-mindedness, and the aim of the Last Judgment is to restore right-mindedness to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Last Judgment might be called a process of right evaluation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It simply means that everyone will finally come to understand what is worthy and what is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>After this, the ability to choose can be directed rationally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Until this distinction is made, however, the vacillations between free and imprisoned will cannot but continue.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"069#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The first step toward freedom involves a sorting out of the false from the true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is a process of separation in the constructive sense, and reflects the true meaning of the Apocalypse.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Everyone will ultimately look upon his own creations and choose to preserve only what is good, just as God Himself looked upon what He had created and knew that it was good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>At this point, the mind can begin to look with love on its own creations because of their worthiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>At the same time the mind will inevitably disown its miscreations which, without belief, will no longer exist.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"069#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The term “Last Judgment” is frightening not only because it has been projected onto God, but also because of the association of “last” with death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is an outstanding example of upside-down perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If the meaning of the Last Judgment is objectively examined, it is quite apparent that it is really the doorway to life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one who lives in fear is really alive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your own last judgment cannot be directed toward yourself, because you are not your own creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can, however, apply it meaningfully and at any time to everything you have made, and retain in your memory only what is creative and good.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is what your right-mindedness cannot but dictate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The purpose of time is solely to “give you time” to achieve this judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is your own perfect judgment of your own perfect creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>When everything you retain is lovable, there is no reason for fear to remain with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"069#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This is your part in the Atonement.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"One of the ways in which you can correct the magic-miracle confusion is to remember that you did not
