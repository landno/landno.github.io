data-sentence-id=\"801#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The role of teaching and learning is actually reversed in the thinking of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The reversal is characteristic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It seems as if the teacher and the learner are separated, the teacher giving something to the learner rather than to himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Further, the act of teaching is regarded as a special activity, in which one engages only a relatively small proportion of one’s time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The course, on the other hand, emphasizes that to teach <i>is</i> to learn, so that teacher and learner are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It also emphasizes that teaching is a constant process; it goes on every moment of the day, and continues into sleeping thoughts as well.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"801#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To teach is to demonstrate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There are only two thought systems, and you demonstrate that you believe one or the other is true all the time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>From your demonstration others learn, and so do you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The question is not whether you will teach, for in that there is no choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The purpose of the course might be said to provide you with a means of choosing what you want to teach on the basis of what you want to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot give to someone else, but only to yourself, and this you learn through teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Teaching is but a call to witnesses to attest to what you believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is a method of conversion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is not done by words alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Any situation must be to you a chance to teach others what you are, and what they are to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>No more than that, but also never less.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"801#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The curriculum you set up is therefore determined exclusively by what you think you are, and what you believe the relationship of others is to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the formal teaching situation, these questions may be totally unrelated to what you think you are teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it is impossible not to use the content of any situation on behalf of what you really teach, and therefore really learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To this the verbal content of your teaching is quite irrelevant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It may coincide with it, or it may not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is the teaching underlying what you say that teaches you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Teaching but reinforces what you believe about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Its fundamental purpose is to diminish self-doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This does not mean that the self you are trying to protect is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But it does mean that the self you think is real is what you teach.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"801#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no escape from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How could it be otherwise?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everyone who follows the world’s curriculum, and everyone here does follow it until he changes his mind, teaches solely to convince himself that he is what he is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Herein is the purpose of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What else, then, would its curriculum be?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Into this hopeless and closed learning situation, which teaches nothing but despair and death, God sends His teachers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And as they teach His lessons of joy and hope, their learning finally becomes complete.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"801#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Except for God’s teachers there would be little hope of salvation, for the world of sin would seem forever real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The self-deceiving must deceive, for they must teach deception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what else is hell?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is a manual for the teachers of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are not perfect, or they would not be here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it is their mission to become perfect here, and so they teach perfection over and over, in many, many ways, until they have learned it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And then they are seen no more, although their thoughts remain a source of strength and truth forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Who are they?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>How are they chosen?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What do they do?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>How can they work out their own salvation and the salvation of the world?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"801#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>This manual attempts to answer these questions.</span></p></div>
