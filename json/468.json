class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea for today reaffirms your commitment to salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It also reminds you that you have no function other than that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Both these thoughts are obviously necessary for a total commitment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation cannot be the only purpose you hold while you still cherish others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The full acceptance of salvation as your only function necessarily entails two phases; the recognition of salvation as your function, and the relinquishment of all the other goals you have invented for yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"468#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the only way in which you can take your rightful place among the saviors of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the only way in which you can say and mean, ‚ÄúMy only function is the one God gave me.‚Äù</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the only way in which you can find peace of mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"468#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today, and for a number of days to follow, set aside ten to fifteen minutes for a more sustained practice period, in which you try to understand and accept what the idea for the day really means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today‚Äôs idea offers you escape from all your perceived difficulties.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It places the key to the door of peace, which you have closed upon yourself, in your own hands.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It gives you the answer to all the searching you have done since time began.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"468#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Try, if possible, to undertake the daily extended practice periods at approximately the same time each day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try, also, to determine this time in advance, and then adhere to it as closely as possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The purpose of this is to arrange your day so that you have set apart the time for God, as well as for all the trivial purposes and goals you will pursue.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is part of the long-range disciplinary training your mind needs, so that the Holy Spirit can use it consistently for the purpose He shares with you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"468#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For the longer practice period, begin by reviewing the idea for the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Then close your eyes, repeat the idea to yourself once again, and watch your mind carefully to catch whatever thoughts cross it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>At first, make no attempt to concentrate only on thoughts related to the idea for the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Rather, try to uncover each thought that arises to interfere with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Note each one as it comes to you, with as little involvement or concern as possible, dismissing each one by telling yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"468#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This thought reflects a goal that is preventing me from accepting my only function.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"468#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>After a while, interfering thoughts will become harder to find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try, however, to continue a minute or so longer, attempting to catch a few of the idle thoughts that escaped your attention before, but do not strain or make undue effort in doing this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"468#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>On this clean slate let my true function be written for me.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"468#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You need not use these exact words, but try to get the sense of being willing to have your illusions of purpose be replaced by truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"468#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Finally, repeat the idea for today once more, and devote the rest of the practice period to trying to focus on its importance to you, the relief its acceptance will bring you by resolving your conflicts once and for all, and the extent to which you really want salvation in spite of your own foolish ideas to the contrary.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"468#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the shorter practice periods, which should be undertaken at least once an hour, use this form in applying today‚Äôs idea:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"468#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>My only function is the one God gave me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I want no other and I have no other.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"468#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Sometimes close your eyes as you practice this, and sometimes keep them open and look about you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is what you see now that will be totally changed when you accept today‚Äôs idea completely.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The idea for today reaffirms your commitment to salvation.
