class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God does not forgive because He has never condemned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And there must be condemnation before forgiveness is necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiveness is the great need of this world, but that is because it is a world of illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Those who forgive are thus releasing themselves from illusions, while those who withhold forgiveness are binding themselves to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As you condemn only yourself, so do you forgive only yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"448#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet although God does not forgive, His Love is nevertheless the basis of forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Fear condemns and love forgives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiveness thus undoes what fear has produced, returning the mind to the awareness of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For this reason, forgiveness can truly be called salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the means by which illusions disappear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"448#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today‚Äôs exercises require at least three full five-minute practice periods, and as many shorter ones as possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Begin the longer practice periods by repeating today‚Äôs idea to yourself, as usual.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Close your eyes as you do so, and spend a minute or two in searching your mind for those whom you have not forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not matter ‚Äúhow much‚Äù you have not forgiven them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have forgiven them entirely or not at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"448#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are doing the exercises well you should have no difficulty in finding a number of people you have not forgiven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a safe rule that anyone you do not like is a suitable subject.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Mention each one by name, and say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"448#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God is the Love in which I forgive you, [name].</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"448#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The purpose of the first phase of today‚Äôs practice periods is to put you in a position to forgive yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>After you have applied the idea to all those who have come to mind, tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"448#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God is the Love in which I forgive myself.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"448#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then devote the remainder of the practice period to adding related ideas such as:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"448#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God is the Love with which I love myself.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God is the Love in which I am blessed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"448#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The form of the application may vary considerably, but the central idea should not be lost sight of.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You might say, for example:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"448#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I cannot be guilty because I am a Son of God.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I have already been forgiven.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No fear is possible in a mind beloved of God.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no need to attack because love has forgiven me.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"448#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The practice period should end, however, with a repetition of today‚Äôs idea as originally stated.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"448#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The shorter practice periods may consist either of a repetition of the idea for today in the original or in a related form, as you prefer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be sure, however, to make more specific applications if they are needed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They will be needed at any time during the day when you become aware of any kind of negative reaction to anyone, present or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"448#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In that event, tell him silently:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"448#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God is the Love in which I forgive you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"God does not forgive because He has never condemned.
