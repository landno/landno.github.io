you can do none of these things.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To believe that you can is to put your trust where trust is unwarranted, and to justify fear, anxiety, depression, anger and sorrow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who can put his faith in weakness and feel safe?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet who can put his faith in strength and feel weak?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"449#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God is your safety in every circumstance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His Voice speaks for Him in all situations and in every aspect of all situations, telling you exactly what to do to call upon His strength and His protection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There are no exceptions because God has no exceptions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And the Voice which speaks for Him thinks as He does.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"449#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we will try to reach past your own weakness to the Source of real strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Four five-minute practice periods are necessary today, and longer and more frequent ones are urged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Close your eyes and begin, as usual, by repeating the idea for the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then spend a minute or two in searching for situations in your life which you have invested with fear, dismissing each one by telling yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"449#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God is the strength in which I trust.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"449#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now try to slip past all concerns related to your own sense of inadequacy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is obvious that any situation that causes you concern is associated with feelings of inadequacy, for otherwise you would believe that you could deal with the situation successfully.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not by trusting yourself that you will gain confidence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But the strength of God in you is successful in all things.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"449#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The recognition of your own frailty is a necessary step in the correction of your errors, but it is hardly a sufficient one in giving you the confidence which you need, and to which you are entitled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You must also gain an awareness that confidence in your real strength is fully justified in every respect and in all circumstances.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"449#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the latter phase of the practice period, try to reach down into your mind to a place of real safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will recognize that you have reached it if you feel a sense of deep peace, however briefly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let go all the trivial things that churn and bubble on the surface of your mind, and reach down and below them to the Kingdom of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is a place in you where there is perfect peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is a place in you where nothing is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is a place in you where the strength of God abides.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"449#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>During the day, repeat the idea often.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Use it as your answer to any disturbance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"449#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember that peace is your right, because you are giving your trust to the strength of God.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"If you are trusting in your own strength, you
