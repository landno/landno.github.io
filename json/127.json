Perception","inlineNumber":"IX."},"annotation":"T-8.IX","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-8-sect-9\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"127#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I said before that the Holy Spirit is the Answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is the Answer to everything, because He knows what the answer to everything is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego does not know what a real question is, although it asks an endless number.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you can learn this as you learn to question the value of the ego, and thus establish your ability to evaluate its questions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When the ego tempts you to sickness do not ask the Holy Spirit to heal the body, for this would merely be to accept the ego’s belief that the body is the proper aim of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ask, rather, that the Holy Spirit teach you the right <i>perception</i> of the body, for perception alone can be distorted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only perception can be sick, because only perception can be wrong.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"127#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Wrong perception is the wish that things be as they are not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The reality of everything is totally harmless, because total harmlessness is the condition of its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is also the condition of your awareness of its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do not have to seek reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It will seek you and find you when you meet its conditions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Its conditions are part of what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And this part only is up to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The rest is of itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You need do so little because your little part is so powerful that it will bring the whole to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Accept, then, your little part, and let the whole be yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"127#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Wholeness heals because it is of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All forms of sickness, even unto death, are physical expressions of the fear of awakening.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are attempts to reinforce sleeping out of fear of waking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is a pathetic way of trying not to see by rendering the faculties for seeing ineffectual.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>“Rest in peace” is a blessing for the living, not the dead, because rest comes from waking, not from sleeping.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Sleep is withdrawing; waking is joining.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Dreams are illusions of joining, because they reflect the ego’s distorted notions about what joining is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet the Holy Spirit, too, has use for sleep, and can use dreams on behalf of waking if you will let Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"127#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How you wake is the sign of how you have used sleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To whom did you give it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Under which teacher did you place it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whenever you wake dispiritedly, it was not given to the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only when you awaken joyously have you utilized sleep according to His purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can indeed be “drugged” by sleep, if you have misused it on behalf of sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Sleep is no more a form of death than death is a form of unconsciousness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Complete unconsciousness is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You can rest in peace only because you are awake.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"127#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing is release from the fear of waking and the substitution of the decision to wake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The decision to wake is the reflection of the will to love, since all healing involves replacing fear with love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit cannot distinguish among degrees of error, for if He taught that one form of sickness is more serious than another, He would be teaching that one error can be more real than another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His function is to distinguish only between the false and the true, replacing the false with the true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"127#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego, which always wants to weaken the mind, tries to separate it from the body in an attempt to destroy it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the ego actually believes that it is protecting it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is because the ego believes that mind is dangerous, and that to make mindless is to heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But to make mindless is impossible, since it would mean to make nothing out of what God created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego despises weakness, even though it makes every effort to induce it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego wants only what it hates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To the ego this is perfectly sensible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Believing in the power of attack, the ego wants attack.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"127#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Bible enjoins you to be perfect, to heal all errors, to take no thought of the body as separate and to accomplish all things in my name.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not my name alone, for ours is a shared identification.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Name of God’s Son is one, and you are enjoined to do the works of love because we share this Oneness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Our minds are whole because they are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you are sick you are withdrawing from me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet you cannot withdraw from me alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You can only withdraw from yourself <i>and</i> me.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"127#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have surely begun to realize that this is a very practical course, and one that means exactly what it says.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I would not ask you to do things you cannot do, and it is impossible that I could do things you cannot do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Given this, and given this quite literally, nothing can prevent you from doing exactly what I ask, and everything argues <i>for</i> your doing it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I give you no limits because God lays none upon you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When you limit yourself we are not of one mind, and that is sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet sickness is not of the body, but of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All forms of sickness are signs that the mind is split, and does not accept a unified purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"127#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The unification of purpose, then, is the Holy Spirit’s only way of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is because it is the only level at which healing means anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The re-establishing of meaning in a chaotic thought system <i>is</i> the way to heal it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your task is only to meet the conditions for meaning, since meaning itself is of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet your return to meaning is essential to His, because your meaning is part of His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your healing, then, is part of His health, since it is part of His Wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He cannot lose this, but you <i>can</i> not know it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"127#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet it is still His Will for you, and His Will must stand forever and in all things.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"I said before that the Holy Spirit is the Answer.
