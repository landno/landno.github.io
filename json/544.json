data-sentence-id=\"544#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the end of choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For here we come to a decision to accept ourselves as God created us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And what is choice except uncertainty of what we are?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no doubt that is not rooted here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no question but reflects this one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no conflict that does not entail the single, simple question, “What am I?”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet who could ask this question except one who has refused to recognize himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only refusal to accept yourself could make the question seem to be sincere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The only thing that can be surely known by any living thing is what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>From this one point of certainty, it looks on other things as certain as itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Uncertainty about what you must be is self-deception on a scale so vast, its magnitude can hardly be conceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To be alive and not to know yourself is to believe that you are really dead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For what is life except to be yourself, and what but you can be alive instead?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who is the doubter?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is it he doubts?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Whom does he question?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who can answer him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He merely states that he is not himself, and therefore, being something else, becomes a questioner of what that something is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet he could never be alive at all unless he knew the answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If he asks as if he does not know, it merely shows he does not want to be the thing he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has accepted it because he lives; has judged against it and denied its worth, and has decided that he does not know the only certainty by which he lives.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus he becomes uncertain of his life, for what it is has been denied by him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is for this denial that you need Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your denial made no change in what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But you have split your mind into what knows and does not know the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no doubt of this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And yet you doubt it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But you do not ask what part of you can really doubt yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It cannot really be a part of you that asks this question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For it asks of one who knows the answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Were it part of you, then certainty would be impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Atonement remedies the strange idea that it is possible to doubt yourself, and be unsure of what you really are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the depth of madness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it is the universal question of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What does this mean except the world is mad?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Why share its madness in the sad belief that what is universal here is true?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing the world believes is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a place whose purpose is to be a home where those who claim they do not know themselves can come to question what it is they are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And they will come again until the time Atonement is accepted, and they learn it is impossible to doubt yourself, and not to be aware of what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only acceptance can be asked of you, for what you are is certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is set forever in the holy Mind of God, and in your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is so far beyond all doubt and question that to ask what it must be is all the proof you need to show that you believe the contradiction that you know not what you cannot fail to know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is this a question, or a statement which denies itself in statement?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let us not allow our holy minds to occupy themselves with senseless musings such as this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have a mission here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We did not come to reinforce the madness that we once believed in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let us not forget the goal that we accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is more than just our happiness alone we came to gain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What we accept as what we are proclaims what everyone must be, along with us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Fail not your brothers, or you fail yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Look lovingly on them, that they may know that they are part of you, and you of them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This does Atonement teach, and demonstrates the Oneness of God’s Son is unassailed by his belief he knows not what he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Today accept Atonement, not to change reality, but merely to accept the truth about yourself, and go your way rejoicing in the endless Love of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is but this that we are asked to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is but this that we will do today.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Five minutes in the morning and at night we will devote to dedicate our minds to our assignment for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We start with this review of what our mission is:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"544#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I will accept Atonement for myself, for I remain as God created me.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"544#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We have not lost the knowledge that God gave to us when He created us like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We can remember it for everyone, for in creation are all minds as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in our memory is the recall how dear our brothers are to us in truth, how much a part of us is every mind, how faithful they have really been to us, and how our Father’s Love contains them all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"544#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In thanks for all creation, in the Name of its Creator and His Oneness with all aspects of creation, we repeat our dedication to our cause today each hour, as we lay aside all thoughts that would distract us from our holy aim.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For several minutes let your mind be cleared of all the foolish cobwebs which the world would weave around the holy Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"544#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And learn the fragile nature of the chains that seem to keep the knowledge of yourself apart from your awareness, as you say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"544#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I will accept Atonement for myself, for I remain as God created me.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Here is the end of choice.
