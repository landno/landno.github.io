a “chance” meeting of two apparent strangers in an elevator, a child who is not looking where he is going running into an adult “by chance,” two students “happening” to walk home together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These are not chance encounters.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each of them has the potential for becoming a teaching-learning situation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perhaps the seeming strangers in the elevator will smile to one another; perhaps the adult will not scold the child for bumping into him; perhaps the students will become friends.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Even at the level of the most casual encounter, it is possible for two people to lose sight of separate interests, if only for a moment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That moment will be enough.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Salvation has come.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"804#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is difficult to understand that levels of teaching the universal course is a concept as meaningless in reality as is time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The illusion of one permits the illusion of the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In time, the teacher of God seems to begin to change his mind about the world with a single decision, and then learns more and more about the new direction as he teaches it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We have covered the illusion of time already, but the illusion of levels of teaching seems to be something different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perhaps the best way to demonstrate that these levels cannot exist is simply to say that any level of the teaching-learning situation is part of God’s plan for Atonement, and His plan can have no levels, being a reflection of His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Salvation is always ready and always there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God’s teachers work at different levels, but the result is always the same.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"804#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Each teaching-learning situation is maximal in the sense that each person involved will learn the most that he can from the other person at that time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this sense, and in this sense only, we can speak of levels of teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Using the term in this way, the second level of teaching is a more sustained relationship, in which, for a time, two people enter into a fairly intense teaching-learning situation and then appear to separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As with the first level, these meetings are not accidental, nor is what appears to be the end of the relationship a real end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Again, each has learned the most he can at the time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet all who meet will someday meet again, for it is the destiny of all relationships to become holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God is not mistaken in His Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"804#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The third level of teaching occurs in relationships which, once they are formed, are lifelong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These are teaching-learning situations in which each person is given a chosen learning partner who presents him with unlimited opportunities for learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These relationships are generally few, because their existence implies that those involved have reached a stage simultaneously in which the teaching-learning balance is actually perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This does not mean that they necessarily recognize this; in fact, they generally do not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They may even be quite hostile to each other for some time, and perhaps for life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet should they decide to learn it, the perfect lesson is before them and can be learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And if they decide to learn that lesson, they become the saviors of the teachers who falter and may even seem to fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"804#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No teacher of God can fail to find the Help he needs.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The teachers of God have no set teaching level.
