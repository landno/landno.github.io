create does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And everything that does exist exists as He created it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The world you see has nothing to do with reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is of your own making, and it does not exist.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"416#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The exercises for today are to be practiced with eyes closed throughout.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The mind-searching period should be short, a minute at most.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not have more than three practice periods with today‚Äôs idea unless you find them comfortable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you do, it will be because you really understand what they are for.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"416#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea for today is another step in learning to let go the thoughts that you have written on the world, and see the Word of God in their place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The early steps in this exchange, which can truly be called salvation, can be quite difficult and even quite painful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Some of them will lead you directly into fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You will not be left there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will go far beyond it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Our direction is toward perfect safety and perfect peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"416#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>With eyes closed, think of all the horrors in the world that cross your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Name each one as it occurs to you, and then deny its reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God did not create it, and so it is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Say, for example:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"416#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God did not create that war, and so it is not real.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God did not create that airplane crash, and so it is not real.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God did not create that disaster [specify], and so it is not real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"416#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Suitable subjects for the application of today‚Äôs idea also include anything you are afraid might happen to you, or to anyone about whom you are concerned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In each case, name the ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù quite specifically.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not use general terms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For example, do not say, ‚ÄúGod did not create illness,‚Äù but, ‚ÄúGod did not create cancer,‚Äù or heart attacks, or whatever may arouse fear in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"416#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is your personal repertory of horrors at which you are looking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These things are part of the world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Some of them are shared illusions, and others are part of your personal hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What God did not create can only be in your own mind apart from His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Therefore, it has no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In recognition of this fact, conclude the practice periods by repeating today‚Äôs idea:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"416#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God did not create a meaningless world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"416#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea for today can, of course, be applied to anything that disturbs you during the day, aside from the practice periods.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be very specific in applying it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"416#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God did not create a meaningless world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"416#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He did not create [specify the situation which is disturbing you], and so it is not real.</span></p></div>
