data-sentence-id=\"605#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You make attempts at kindness and forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you turn them to attack again, unless you find external gratitude and lavish thanks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your gifts must be received with honor, lest they be withdrawn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so you think God‚Äôs gifts are loans at best; at worst, deceptions which would cheat you of defenses, to ensure that when He strikes He will not fail to kill.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"605#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How easily are God and guilt confused by those who know not what their thoughts can do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Deny your strength, and weakness must become salvation to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>See yourself as bound, and bars become your home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor will you leave the prison house, or claim your strength, until guilt and salvation are not seen as one, and freedom and salvation are perceived as joined, with strength beside them, to be sought and claimed, and found and fully recognized.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"605#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world must thank you when you offer it release from your illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet your thanks belong to you as well, for its release can only mirror yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your gratitude is all your gifts require, that they be a lasting offering of a thankful heart, released from hell forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is it this you would undo by taking back your gifts, because they were not honored?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is you who honor them and give them fitting thanks, for it is you who have received the gifts.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"605#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It does not matter if another thinks your gifts unworthy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In his mind there is a part that joins with yours in thanking you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It does not matter if your gifts seem lost and ineffectual.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are received where they are given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In your gratitude are they accepted universally, and thankfully acknowledged by the Heart of God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And would you take them back, when He has gratefully accepted them?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"605#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God blesses every gift you give to Him, and every gift is given Him, because it can be given only to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what belongs to God must be His Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you will never realize His gifts are sure, eternal, changeless, limitless, forever giving out, extending love and adding to your never-ending joy while you forgive but to attack again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"605#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Withdraw the gifts you give, and you will think that what is given you has been withdrawn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But learn to let forgiveness take away the sins you think you see outside yourself, and you can never think the gifts of God are lent but for a little while, before He snatches them away again in death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For death will have no meaning for you then.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"605#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And with the end of this belief is fear forever over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Thank your Self for this, for He is grateful only unto God, and He gives thanks for you unto Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To everyone who lives will Christ yet come, for everyone must live and move in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His Being in His Father is secure, because Their Will is One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Their gratitude to all They have created has no end, for gratitude remains a part of love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"605#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thanks be to you, the holy Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For as you were created, you contain all things within your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you are still as God created you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor can you dim the light of your perfection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In your heart the Heart of God is laid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He holds you dear, because you are Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All gratitude belongs to you, because of what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"605#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Give thanks as you receive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be you free of all ingratitude to anyone who makes your Self complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And from this Self is no one left outside.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Give thanks for all the countless channels which extend this Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All that you do is given unto Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All that you think can only be His Thoughts, sharing with Him the holy Thoughts of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Earn now the gratitude you have denied yourself when you forgot the function God has given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"605#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But never think that He has ever ceased to offer thanks to you.</span></p></div>
