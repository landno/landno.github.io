<span data-sentence-id=\"515#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our next review begins today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We will review two recent lessons every day for ten successive days of practicing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will observe a special format for these practice periods, that you are urged to follow just as closely as you can.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We understand, of course, that it may be impossible for you to undertake what is suggested here as optimal each day and every hour of the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Learning will not be hampered when you miss a practice period because it is impossible at the appointed time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor is it necessary that you make excessive efforts to be sure that you catch up in terms of numbers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Rituals are not our aim, and would defeat our goal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But learning will be hampered when you skip a practice period because you are unwilling to devote the time to it that you are asked to give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not deceive yourself in this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Unwillingness can be most carefully concealed behind a cloak of situations you cannot control.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Learn to distinguish situations that are poorly suited to your practicing from those that you establish to uphold a camouflage for your unwillingness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those practice periods that you have lost because you did not want to do them, for whatever reason, should be done as soon as you have changed your mind about your goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are unwilling to cooperate in practicing salvation only if it interferes with goals you hold more dear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you withdraw the value given them, allow your practice periods to be replacements for your litanies to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They gave you nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But your practicing can offer everything to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And so accept their offering and be at peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The format you should use for these reviews is this: Devote five minutes twice a day, or longer if you would prefer it, to considering the thoughts that are assigned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Read over the ideas and comments that are written down for each day’s exercise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And then begin to think about them, while letting your mind relate them to your needs, your seeming problems and all your concerns.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Place the ideas within your mind, and let it use them as it chooses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Give it faith that it will use them wisely, being helped in its decisions by the One Who gave the thoughts to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What can you trust but what is in your mind?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Have faith, in these reviews, the means the Holy Spirit uses will not fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The wisdom of your mind will come to your assistance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Give direction at the outset; then lean back in quiet faith, and let the mind employ the thoughts you gave as they were given you for it to use.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have been given them in perfect trust; in perfect confidence that you would use them well; in perfect faith that you would see their messages and use them for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Offer them to your mind in that same trust and confidence and faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It will not fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the Holy Spirit’s chosen means for your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Since it has His trust, His means must surely merit yours as well.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We emphasize the benefits to you if you devote the first five minutes of the day to your reviews, and also give the last five minutes of your waking day to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If this cannot be done, at least try to divide them so you undertake one in the morning, and the other in the hour just before you go to sleep.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The exercises to be done throughout the day are equally important, and perhaps of even greater value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have been inclined to practice only at appointed times, and then go on your way to other things, without applying what you learned to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As a result, you have gained little reinforcement, and have not given your learning a fair chance to prove how great are its potential gifts to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here is another chance to use it well.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In these reviews, we stress the need to let your learning not lie idly by between your longer practice periods.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Attempt to give your daily two ideas a brief but serious review each hour.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Use one on the hour, and the other one a half an hour later.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You need not give more than just a moment to each one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Repeat it, and allow your mind to rest a little time in silence and in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Then turn to other things, but try to keep the thought with you, and let it serve to help you keep your peace throughout the day as well.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are shaken, think of it again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These practice periods are planned to help you form the habit of applying what you learn each day to everything you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not repeat the thought and lay it down.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its usefulness is limitless to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is meant to serve you in all ways, all times and places, and whenever you need help of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Try, then, to take it with you in the business of the day and make it holy, worthy of God’s Son, acceptable to God and to your Self.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Each day’s review assignments will conclude with a restatement of the thought to use each hour, and the one to be applied on each half hour as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Forget them not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This second chance with each of these ideas will bring such large advances that we come from these reviews with learning gains so great we will continue on more solid ground, with firmer footsteps and with stronger faith.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"515#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"515#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not forget how little you have learned. <br/></span><span data-sentence-id=\"515#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not forget how much you can learn now. <br/></span><span data-sentence-id=\"515#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not forget your Father’s need of you, <br/>As you review these thoughts He gave to you.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Our next review begins today.
