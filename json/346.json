<span data-sentence-id=\"346#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a tendency to think the world can offer consolation and escape from problems that its purpose is to keep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Why should this be?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Because it is a place where choice among illusions seems to be the only choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you are in control of outcomes of your choosing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus you think, within the narrow band from birth to death, a little time is given you to use for you alone; a time when everyone conflicts with you, but you can choose which road will lead you out of conflict, and away from difficulties that concern you not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet they <i>are</i> your concern.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How, then, can you escape from them by leaving them behind?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What must go with you, you will take with you whatever road you choose to walk along.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Real choice is no illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But the world has none to offer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All its roads but lead to disappointment, nothingness and death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no choice in its alternatives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Seek not escape from problems here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The world was made that problems could not <i>be</i> escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Be not deceived by all the different names its roads are given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They have but one end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And each is but the means to gain that end, for it is here that all its roads will lead, however differently they seem to start; however differently they seem to go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Their end is certain, for there is no choice among them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>All of them will lead to death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>On some you travel gaily for a while, before the bleakness enters.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>And on some the thorns are felt at once.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#2:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>The choice is not what will the ending be, but when it comes.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no choice where every end is sure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you would prefer to try them all, before you really learn they are but one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The roads this world can offer seem to be quite large in number, but the time must come when everyone begins to see how like they are to one another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Men have died on seeing this, because they saw no way except the pathways offered by the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And learning they led nowhere, lost their hope.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And yet this was the time they could have learned their greatest lesson.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All must reach this point, and go beyond it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is true indeed there is no choice at all within the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But this is not the lesson in itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The lesson has a purpose, and in this you come to understand what it is for.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why would you seek to try another road, another person or another place, when you have learned the way the lesson starts, but do not yet perceive what it is for?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its purpose is the answer to the search that all must undertake who still believe there is another answer to be found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Learn now, without despair, there is no hope of answer in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But do not judge the lesson that is but begun with this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Seek not another signpost in the world that seems to point to still another road.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No longer look for hope where there is none.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Make fast your learning now, and understand you but waste time unless you go beyond what you have learned to what is yet to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For from this lowest point will learning lead to heights of happiness, in which you see the purpose of the lesson shining clear, and perfectly within your learning grasp.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who would be willing to be turned away from all the roadways of the world, unless he understood their real futility?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is it not needful that he should begin with this, to seek another way instead?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For while he sees a choice where there is none, what power of decision can he use?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The great release of power must begin with learning where it really has a use.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what decision has power if it be applied in situations without choice?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The learning that the world can offer but one choice, no matter what its form may be, is the beginning of acceptance that there is a real alternative instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To fight against this step is to defeat your purpose here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You did not come to learn to find a road the world does not contain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The search for different pathways in the world is but the search for different forms of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this would <i>keep</i> the truth from being reached.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think not that happiness is ever found by following a road away from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This makes no sense, and cannot be the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To you who seem to find this course to be too difficult to learn, let me repeat that to achieve a goal you must proceed in its direction, not away from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And every road that leads the other way will not advance the purpose to be found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If this be difficult to understand, then is this course impossible to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But only then.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For otherwise, it is a simple teaching in the obvious.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There <i>is</i> a choice that you have power to make when you have seen the real alternatives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Until that point is reached you have no choice, and you can but decide how you would choose the better to deceive yourself again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This course attempts to teach no more than that the power of decision cannot lie in choosing different forms of what is still the same illusion and the same mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All choices in the world depend on this; you choose between your brother and yourself, and you will gain as much as he will lose, and what you lose is what is given him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How utterly opposed to truth is this, when all the lesson’s purpose is to teach that what your brother loses <i>you</i> have lost, and what he gains is what is given <i>you.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He has not left His Thoughts!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But you forgot His Presence and remembered not His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No pathway in the world can lead to Him, nor any worldly goal be one with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What road in all the world will lead within, when every road was made to separate the journey from the purpose it must have unless it be but futile wandering?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All roads that lead away from what you are will lead you to confusion and despair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet has He never left His Thoughts to die, without their Source forever in themselves.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He has not left His Thoughts!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He could no more depart from them than they could keep Him out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In unity with Him do they abide, and in Their Oneness Both are kept complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no road that leads away from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A journey from yourself does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How foolish and insane it is to think that there could be a road with such an aim!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Where could it go?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And how could you be made to travel on it, walking there without your own reality at one with you?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"346#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgive yourself your madness, and forget all senseless journeys and all goal-less aims.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They have no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can not escape from what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For God is merciful, and did not let His Son abandon Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For what He is be thankful, for in that is your escape from madness and from death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nowhere but where He is can you be found.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"346#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There <i>is</i> no path that does not lead to Him.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"There is a tendency to think the world can
