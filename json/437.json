<span data-sentence-id=\"437#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today‚Äôs idea does not describe the way you see yourself now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does, however, describe what vision will show you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is difficult for anyone who thinks he is in this world to believe this of himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the reason he thinks he is in this world is because he does not believe it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"437#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will believe that you are part of where you think you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is because you surround yourself with the environment you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you want it to protect the image of yourself that you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The image is part of this environment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you see while you believe you are in it is seen through the eyes of the image.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is not vision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Images cannot see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"437#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea for today presents a very different view of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>By establishing your Source it establishes your Identity, and it describes you as you must really be in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We will use a somewhat different kind of application for today‚Äôs idea because the emphasis for today is on the perceiver, rather than on what he perceives.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"437#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For each of the three five-minute practice periods today, begin by repeating today‚Äôs idea to yourself, and then close your eyes and search your mind for the various kinds of descriptive terms in which you see yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Include all the ego-based attributes which you ascribe to yourself, positive or negative, desirable or undesirable, grandiose or debased.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All of them are equally unreal, because you do not look upon yourself through the eyes of holiness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"437#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the earlier part of the mind-searching period, you will probably emphasize what you consider to be the more negative aspects of your perception of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Toward the latter part of the exercise period, however, more self-inflating descriptive terms may well cross your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Try to recognize that the direction of your fantasies about yourself does not matter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Illusions have no direction in reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are merely not true.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"437#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A suitable unselected list for applying the idea for today might be as follows:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I see myself as imposed on.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I see myself as depressed.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I see myself as failing.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I see myself as endangered.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I see myself as helpless.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I see myself as victorious.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I see myself as losing out.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I see myself as charitable.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I see myself as virtuous.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"437#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You should not think of these terms in an abstract way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They will occur to you as various situations, personalities and events in which you figure cross your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Pick up any specific situation that occurs to you, identify the descriptive term or terms you feel are applicable to your reactions to that situation, and use them in applying today‚Äôs idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>After you have named each one, add:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"437#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But my mind is part of God‚Äôs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I am very holy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"437#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>During the longer exercise periods, there will probably be intervals in which nothing specific occurs to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not strain to think up specific things to fill the interval, but merely relax and repeat today‚Äôs idea slowly until something occurs to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Although nothing that does occur should be omitted from the exercises, nothing should be ‚Äúdug out‚Äù with effort.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Neither force nor discrimination should be used.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"437#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As often as possible during the day, pick up a specific attribute or attributes you are ascribing to yourself at the time and apply the idea for today to them, adding the idea in the form stated above to each of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"437#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If nothing particular occurs to you, merely repeat the idea to yourself, with closed eyes.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today‚Äôs idea does not describe the way you see yourself now.
