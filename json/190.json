<span data-sentence-id=\"190#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Can you imagine what it means to have no cares, no worries, no anxieties, but merely to be perfectly calm and quiet all the time?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet that is what time is for; to learn just that and nothing more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s Teacher cannot be satisfied with His teaching until it constitutes all your learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has not fulfilled His teaching function until you have become such a consistent learner that you learn only of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When this has happened, you will no longer need a teacher or time in which to learn.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>One source of perceived discouragement from which you may suffer is your belief that this takes time, and that the results of the Holy Spirit’s teaching are far in the future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For the Holy Spirit uses time in His Own way, and is not bound by it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Time is His friend in teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It does not waste Him, as it does you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And all the waste that time seems to bring with it is due but to your identification with the ego, which uses time to support its belief in destruction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ego, like the Holy Spirit, uses time to convince you of the inevitability of the goal and end of teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To the ego the goal is death, which <i>is</i> its end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But to the Holy Spirit the goal is life, which <i>has</i> no end.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is an ally of time, but not a friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it is as mistrustful of death as it is of life, and what it wants for you it cannot tolerate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego wants <i>you</i> dead, but not itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The outcome of its strange religion must therefore be the conviction that it can pursue you beyond the grave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And out of its unwillingness for you to find peace even in death, it offers you immortality in hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It speaks to you of Heaven, but assures you that Heaven is not for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How can the guilty hope for Heaven?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The belief in hell is inescapable to those who identify with the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Their nightmares and their fears are all associated with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego teaches that hell is in the future, for this is what all its teaching is directed to.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Hell is its goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For although the ego aims at death and dissolution as an end, it does not believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The goal of death, which it craves for you, leaves it unsatisfied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one who follows the ego’s teaching is without the fear of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet if death were thought of merely as an end to pain, would it be feared?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>We have seen this strange paradox in the ego’s thought system before, but never so clearly as here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For the ego must seem to keep fear from you to hold your allegiance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet it must engender fear in order to maintain itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Again the ego tries, and all too frequently succeeds, in doing both, by using dissociation for holding its contradictory aims together so that they seem to be reconciled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>The ego teaches thus: Death is the end as far as hope of Heaven goes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>Yet because you and the ego cannot be separated, and because it cannot conceive of its own death, it will pursue you still, because guilt is eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>Such is the ego’s version of immortality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#4:16\"><span class=\"snr\">16</span>And it is this the ego’s version of time supports.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego teaches that Heaven is here and now because the future is hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Even when it attacks so savagely that it tries to take the life of someone who thinks its is the only voice, it speaks of hell even to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it tells him hell is here as well, and bids him leap from hell into oblivion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The only time the ego allows anyone to look upon with equanimity is the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And even there, its only value is that it is no more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How bleak and despairing is the ego’s use of time!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And how terrifying!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For underneath its fanatical insistence that the past and future be the same is hidden a far more insidious threat to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego does not advertise its final threat, for it would have its worshippers still believe that it can offer them escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But the belief in guilt must lead to the belief in hell, and always does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The only way in which the ego allows the fear of hell to be experienced is to bring hell here, but always as a foretaste of the future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For no one who considers himself as deserving of hell can believe that punishment will end in peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit teaches thus: There is no hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Hell is only what the ego has made of the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The belief in hell is what prevents you from understanding the present, because you are afraid of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit leads as steadily to Heaven as the ego drives to hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the Holy Spirit, Who knows only the present, uses it to undo the fear by which the ego would make the present useless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no escape from fear in the ego’s use of time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For time, according to its teaching, is nothing but a teaching device for compounding guilt until it becomes all-encompassing, demanding vengeance forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit would undo all of this <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Fear is not of the present, but only of the past and future, which do not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no fear in the present when each instant stands clear and separated from the past, without its shadow reaching out into the future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each instant is a clean, untarnished birth, in which the Son of God emerges from the past into the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And the present extends forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is so beautiful and so clean and free of guilt that nothing but happiness is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No darkness is remembered, and immortality and joy are now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This lesson takes no time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For what is time without a past and future?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It has taken time to misguide you so completely, but it takes no time at all to be what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Begin to practice the Holy Spirit’s use of time as a teaching aid to happiness and peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Take this very instant, now, and think of it as all there is of time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing can reach you here out of the past, and it is here that you are completely absolved, completely free and wholly without condemnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>From this holy instant wherein holiness was born again you will go forth in time without fear, and with no sense of change with time.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Time is inconceivable without change, yet holiness does not change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Learn from this instant more than merely that hell does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In this redeeming instant lies Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And Heaven will not change, for the birth into the holy present is salvation from change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Change is an illusion, taught by those who cannot see themselves as guiltless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no change in Heaven because there is no change in God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In the holy instant, in which you see yourself as bright with freedom, you will remember God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For remembering Him <i>is</i> to remember freedom.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are tempted to be dispirited by thinking how long it would take to change your mind so completely, ask yourself, “How long is an instant?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Could you not give so short a time to the Holy Spirit for your salvation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He asks no more, for He has no need of more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It takes far longer to teach you to be willing to give Him this than for Him to use this tiny instant to offer you the whole of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In exchange for this instant He stands ready to give you the remembrance of eternity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will never give this holy instant to the Holy Spirit on behalf of your release while you are unwilling to give it to your brothers on behalf of theirs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the instant of holiness is shared, and cannot be yours alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember, then, when you are tempted to attack a brother, that his instant of release is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Miracles are the instants of release you offer, and will receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They

short for your brother as it is for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Practice giving this blessed instant of freedom to all who are enslaved by time, and thus make time their friend for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit gives their blessed instant to you through your giving it.</span> <span

class=\"snr\">3</span>As long as it takes to remember immortality, and your immortal creations who share it with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As long as it takes to exchange hell for Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Long enough to transcend all of the ego’s making, and ascend unto your Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"190#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Time is your

data-sentence-id=\"190#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He Who transcends time for you understands what time is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Holiness lies not in time, but in eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"190#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There never was an instant in which God’s Son could lose his purity.</span> <span
