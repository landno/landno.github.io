data-sentence-id=\"265#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you come to the place where the branch in the road is quite apparent, you cannot go ahead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You must go either one way or the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For now if you go straight ahead, the way you went before you reached the branch, you will go nowhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The whole purpose of coming this far was to decide which branch you will take now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The way you came no longer matters.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It can no longer serve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one who reaches this far can make the wrong decision, although he can delay.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And there is no part of the journey that seems more hopeless and futile than standing where the road branches, and not deciding on which way to go.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"265#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is but the first few steps along the right way that seem hard, for you have chosen, although you still may think you can go back and make the other choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A choice made with the power of Heaven to uphold it cannot be undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your way is decided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There will be nothing you will not be told, if you acknowledge this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"265#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And so you and your brother stand, here in this holy place, before the veil of sin that hangs between you and the face of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let it be lifted!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Raise it together with your brother, for it is but a veil that stands between you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Either you or your brother alone will see it as a solid block, nor realize how thin the drapery that separates you now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it is almost over in your awareness, and peace has reached you even here, before the veil.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Think what will happen after.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Love of Christ will light your face, and shine from it into a darkened world that needs the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And from this holy place He will return with you, not leaving it nor you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You will become His messenger, returning Him unto Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"265#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think of the loveliness that you will see, who walk with Him!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And think how beautiful will you and your brother look to the other!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How happy you will be to be together, after such a long and lonely journey where you walked alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The gates of Heaven, open now for you, will you now open to the sorrowful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And none who looks upon the Christ in you but will rejoice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How beautiful the sight you saw beyond the veil, which you will bring to light the tired eyes of those as weary now as once you were.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How thankful will they be to see you come among them, offering Christ’s forgiveness to dispel their faith in sin.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"265#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every mistake you and your brother make, the other will gently have corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For in his sight your loveliness is his salvation, which he would protect from harm.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you will be your brother’s strong protector from everything that seems to rise between you both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>So shall you walk the world with me, whose message has not yet been given everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For you are here to let it be received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God’s offer still is open, yet it waits acceptance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>From you who have accepted it is it received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Into your hand, joined with your brother’s, is it safely given, for you who share it have become its willing guardian and protector.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"265#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To all who share the Love of God the grace is given to be the givers of what they have received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so they learn that it is theirs forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All barriers disappear before their coming, as every obstacle was finally surmounted that seemed to rise and block their way before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This veil you and your brother lift together opens the way to truth to more than you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Those who would let illusions be lifted from their minds are this world’s saviors, walking the world with their Redeemer, and carrying His message of hope and freedom and release from suffering to everyone who needs a miracle to save him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"265#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How easy is it to offer this miracle to everyone!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one who has received it for himself could find it difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For by receiving it, he learned it was not given him alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Such is the function of a holy relationship; to receive together and give as you received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Standing before the veil, it still seems difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But hold out your hand, joined with your brother’s, and touch this heavy-seeming block, and you will learn how easily your fingers slip through its nothingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is no solid wall.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"265#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And only an illusion stands between you and your brother, and the holy Self you share together.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"When you come to the place where the branch in the road is quite apparent, you cannot
