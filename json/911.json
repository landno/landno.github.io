<span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who, then, is the therapist, and who is the patient?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the end, everyone is both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He who needs healing must heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Physician, heal thyself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who else is there to heal?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And who else is in need of healing?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Each patient who comes to a therapist offers him a chance to heal himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is therefore his therapist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And every therapist must learn to heal from each patient who comes to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He thus becomes his patient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>God does not know of separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>What He knows is only that He has one Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>His knowledge is reflected in the ideal patient-therapist relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#1:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>God comes to him who calls, and in Him he recognizes Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"911#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think carefully, teacher and therapist, for whom you pray, and who is in need of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For therapy is prayer, and healing is its aim and its result.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What is prayer except the joining of minds in a relationship which Christ can enter?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is His home, into which psychotherapy invites Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is symptom cure, when another is always there to choose?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But once Christ enters in, what choice is there except to have Him stay?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no need for more than this, for it is everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Healing is here, and happiness and peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>These are the “symptoms” of the ideal patient-therapist relationship, replacing those with which the patient came to ask for help.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"911#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The process that takes place in this relationship is actually one in which the therapist in his heart tells the patient that all his sins have been forgiven him, along with his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What could be the difference between healing and forgiveness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only Christ forgives, knowing His sinlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His vision heals perception and sickness disappears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor will it return again, once its cause has been removed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This, however, needs the help of a very advanced therapist, capable of joining with the patient in a holy relationship in which all sense of separation finally is overcome.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"911#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>For this, one thing and one thing only is required: The therapist in no way confuses himself with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All “unhealed healers” make this fundamental confusion in one form or another, because they must regard themselves as self-created rather than God-created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This confusion is rarely if ever in awareness, or the unhealed healer would instantly become a teacher of God, devoting his life to the function of true healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Before he reached this point, he thought he was in charge of the therapeutic process and was therefore responsible for its outcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His patient’s errors thus became his own failures, and guilt became the cover, dark and strong, for what should be the Holiness of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Guilt is inevitable in those who use their judgment in making their decisions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Guilt is impossible in those through whom the Holy Spirit speaks.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"911#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The passing of guilt is the true aim of therapy and the obvious aim of forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this their oneness can be clearly seen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet who could experience the end of guilt who feels responsible for his brother in the role of guide for him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Such a function presupposes a knowledge that no one here can have; a certainty of past, present and future, and of all the effects that may occur in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only from this omniscient point of view would such a role be possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet no perception is omniscient, nor is the tiny self of one alone against the universe able to assume he has such wisdom except in madness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That many therapists are mad is obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No unhealed healer can be wholly sane.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"911#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet it is as insane not to accept a function God has given you as to invent one He has not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The advanced therapist in no way can ever doubt the power that is in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor does he doubt its Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He understands all power in earth and Heaven belongs to him because of who he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And he is this because of his Creator, Whose Love is in him and Who cannot fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Think what this means; he has the gifts of God Himself to give away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His patients are God’s saints, who call upon his sanctity to make it theirs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And as he gives it to them, they behold Christ’s shining face as it looks back at them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"911#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The insane, thinking they are God, are not afraid to offer weakness to God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But what they see in him because of this they fear indeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The unhealed healer cannot but be fearful of his patients, and suspect them of the treachery he sees in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He tries to heal, and thus at times he may.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But he will not succeed except to some extent and for a little while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He does not see the Christ in him who calls.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What answer can he give to one who seems to be a stranger; alien to the truth and poor in wisdom, without the god who must be given him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Behold your God in him, for what you see will be your Answer.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"911#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Think what the joining of two brothers really means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And then forget the world and all its little triumphs and its dreams of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The same are one, and nothing now can be remembered of the world of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The room becomes a temple, and the street a stream of stars that brushes lightly past all sickly dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Healing is done, for what is perfect needs no healing, and what remains to be forgiven where there is no sin?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"911#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be thankful, therapist, that you can see such things as this, if you but understand your proper role.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But if you fail in this, you have denied that God created you, and so you will not know you are His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who is your brother now?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What saint can come to take you home with him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You lost the way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And can you now expect to see in him an answer that you have refused to give?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Heal and be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There is no other choice of pathways that can ever lead to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>O let your patient in, for he has come to you from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"911#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Is not his holiness enough to wake your memory of Him?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Who, then, is the therapist, and who is the patient?
