data-sentence-id=\"572#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All things are given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God’s trust in you is limitless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He knows His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He gives without exception, holding nothing back that can contribute to your happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And yet, unless your will is one with His, His gifts are not received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But what would make you think there is another will than His?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the paradox that underlies the making of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This world is not the Will of God, and so it is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet those who think it real must still believe there is another will, and one that leads to opposite effects from those He wills.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Impossible indeed; but every mind that looks upon the world and judges it as certain, solid, trustworthy and true believes in two creators; or in one, himself alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But never in one God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The gifts of God are not acceptable to anyone who holds such strange beliefs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He must believe that to accept God’s gifts, however evident they may become, however urgently he may be called to claim them as his own, is to be pressed to treachery against himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He must deny their presence, contradict the truth, and suffer to preserve the world he made.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the only home he thinks he knows.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here is the only safety he believes that he can find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Without the world he made is he an outcast; homeless and afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He does not realize that it is here he is afraid indeed, and homeless, too; an outcast wandering so far from home, so long away, he does not realize he has forgotten where he came from, where he goes, and even who he really is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet in his lonely, senseless wanderings, God’s gifts go with him, all unknown to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He cannot lose them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But he will not look at what is given him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He wanders on, aware of the futility he sees about him everywhere, perceiving how his little lot but dwindles, as he goes ahead to nowhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Still he wanders on in misery and poverty, alone though God is with him, and a treasure his so great that everything the world contains is valueless before its magnitude.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>He seems a sorry figure; weary, worn, in threadbare clothing, and with feet that bleed a little from the rocky road he walks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one but has identified with him, for everyone who comes here has pursued the path he follows, and has felt defeat and hopelessness as he is feeling them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet is he really tragic, when you see that he is following the way he chose, and need but realize Who walks with him and open up his treasures to be free?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is your chosen self, the one you made as a replacement for reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the self you savagely defend against all reason, every evidence, and all the witnesses with proof to show this is not you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You heed them not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You go on your appointed way, with eyes cast down lest you might catch a glimpse of truth, and be released from self-deception and set free.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cower fearfully lest you should feel Christ’s touch upon your shoulder, and perceive His gentle hand directing you to look upon your gifts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How could you then proclaim your poverty in exile?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He would make you laugh at this perception of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where is self-pity then?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what becomes of all the tragedy you sought to make for him whom God intended only joy?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your ancient fear has come upon you now, and justice has caught up with you at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Christ’s hand has touched your shoulder, and you feel that you are not alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You even think the miserable self you thought was you may not be your Identity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perhaps God’s Word is truer than your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perhaps His gifts to you are real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perhaps He has not wholly been outwitted by your plan to keep His Son in deep oblivion, and go the way you chose without your Self.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s Will does not oppose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It merely is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not God you have imprisoned in your plan to lose your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He does not know about a plan so alien to His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There was a need He did not understand, to which He gave an Answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you who have this Answer given you have need no more of anything but this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now do we live, for now we cannot die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The wish for death is answered, and the sight that looked upon it now has been replaced by vision which perceives that you are not what you pretend to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>One walks with you Who gently answers all your fears with this one merciful reply, “It is not so.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He points to all the gifts you have each time the thought of poverty oppresses you, and speaks of His Companionship when you perceive yourself as lonely and afraid.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet He reminds you still of one thing more you had forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For His touch on you has made you like Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The gifts you have are not for you alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What He has come to offer you, you now must learn to give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the lesson that His giving holds, for He has saved you from the solitude you sought to make in which to hide from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He has reminded you of all the gifts that God has given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He speaks as well of what becomes your will when you accept these gifts, and recognize they are your own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The gifts are yours, entrusted to your care, to give to all who chose the lonely road you have escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They do not understand they but pursue their wishes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is you who teach them now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you have learned of Christ there is another way for them to walk.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Teach them by showing them the happiness that comes to those who feel the touch of Christ, and recognize God’s gifts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let sorrow not tempt you to be unfaithful to your trust.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your sighs will now betray the hopes of those who look to you for their release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your tears are theirs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you are sick, you but withhold their healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you fear but teaches them their fears are justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your hand becomes the giver of Christ’s touch; your change of mind becomes the proof that who accepts God’s gifts can never suffer anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are entrusted with the world’s release from pain.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"572#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Betray it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Become the living proof of what Christ’s touch can offer everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God has entrusted all His gifts to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Be witness in your happiness to how transformed the mind becomes which chooses to accept His gifts, and feel the touch of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Such is your mission now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For God entrusts the giving of His gifts to all who have received them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He has shared His joy with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"572#15:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And now you go to share it with the world.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"All things are given you.
