data-sentence-id=\"924#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Prayer has no beginning and no end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a part of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But it does change in form, and grow with learning until it reaches its formless state, and fuses into total communication with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In its asking form it need not, and often does not, make appeal to God, or even involve belief in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>At these levels prayer is merely wanting, out of a sense of scarcity and lack.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"924#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These forms of prayer, or asking-out-of-need, always involve feelings of weakness and inadequacy, and could never be made by a Son of God who knows Who he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one, then, who is sure of his Identity could pray in these forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it is also true that no one who is uncertain of his Identity can avoid praying in this way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And prayer is as continual as life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everyone prays without ceasing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ask and you have received, for you have established what it is you want.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"924#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is also possible to reach a higher form of asking-out-of-need, for in this world prayer is reparative, and so it must entail levels of learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Here, the asking may be addressed to God in honest belief, though not yet with understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A vague and usually unstable sense of identification has generally been reached, but tends to be blurred by a deep-rooted sense of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is possible at this level to continue to ask for things of this world in various forms, and it is also possible to ask for gifts such as honesty or goodness, and particularly for forgiveness for the many sources of guilt that inevitably underlie any prayer of need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Without guilt there is no scarcity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The sinless have no needs.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"924#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>At this level also comes that curious contradiction in terms known as “praying for one’s enemies.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The contradiction lies not in the actual words, but rather in the way in which they are usually interpreted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>While you believe you have enemies, you have limited prayer to the laws of this world, and have also limited your ability to receive and to accept to the same narrow margins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet, if you have enemies you have need of prayer, and great need, too.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What does the phrase really mean?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Pray for yourself, that you may not seek to imprison Christ and thereby lose the recognition of your own Identity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Be traitor to no one, or you will be treacherous to yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"924#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>An enemy is the symbol of an imprisoned Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And who could He be except yourself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The prayer for enemies thus becomes a prayer for your own freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now it is no longer a contradiction in terms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It has become a statement of the unity of Christ and a recognition of His sinlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And now it has become holy, for it acknowledges the Son of God as he was created.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"924#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let it never be forgotten that prayer at any level is always for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you unite with anyone in prayer, you make him part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The enemy is you, as is the Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Before it can become holy, then, prayer becomes a choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not choose for another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You can but choose for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Pray truly for your enemies, for herein lies your own salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Forgive them for your sins, and you will be forgiven indeed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"924#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Prayer is a ladder reaching up to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>At the top there is a transformation much like your own, for prayer is part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The things of earth are left behind, all unremembered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no asking, for there is no lack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Identity in Christ is fully recognized as set forever, beyond all change and incorruptible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The light no longer flickers, and will never go out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Now, without needs of any kind, and clad forever in the pure sinlessness that is the gift of God to you, His Son, prayer can again become what it was meant to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For now it rises as a song of thanks to your Creator, sung without words, or thoughts, or vain desires, unneedful now of anything at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>So it extends, as it was meant to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And for this giving God Himself gives thanks.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"924#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God is the goal of every prayer, giving it timelessness instead of end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor has it a beginning, because the goal has never changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Prayer in its earlier forms is an illusion, because there is no need for a ladder to reach what one has never left.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet prayer is part of forgiveness as long as forgiveness, itself an illusion, remains unattained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Prayer is tied up with learning until the goal of learning has been reached.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And then all things will be transformed together, and returned unblemished into the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Being beyond learning, this state cannot be described.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"924#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The stages necessary to its attainment, however, need to be understood, if peace is to be restored to God’s Son, who lives now with the illusion of death and the fear of God.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Prayer has no beginning and no end.
