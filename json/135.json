<span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s Will is your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would He not have given you the means to find it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If He wills you to have it, He must have made it possible and easy to obtain it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your brothers are everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not have to seek far for salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Every minute and every second gives you a chance to save yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not lose these chances, not because they will not return, but because delay of joy is needless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God wills you perfect happiness now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Is it possible that this is not also your will?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And is it possible that this is not also the will of your brothers?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"135#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Consider, then, that in this joint will you are all united, and in this only.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There may be disagreement on anything else, but not on this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This, then, is where peace abides.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you abide in peace when you so decide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you cannot abide in peace unless you accept the Atonement, because the Atonement <i>is</i> the way to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The reason is very simple, and so obvious that it is often overlooked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ego is afraid of the obvious, since obviousness is the essential characteristic of reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet <i>you</i> cannot overlook it unless you are not looking.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"135#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is perfectly obvious that if the Holy Spirit looks with love on all He perceives, He looks with love on you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His evaluation of you is based on His knowledge of what you are, and so He evaluates you truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this evaluation must be in your mind, because He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego is also in your mind, because you have accepted it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its evaluation of you, however, is the exact opposite of the Holy Spirit’s, because the ego does not love you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is unaware of what you are, and wholly mistrustful of everything it perceives because its perceptions are so shifting.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ego is therefore capable of suspiciousness at best and viciousness at worst.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>That is its range.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It cannot exceed it because of its uncertainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And it can never go beyond it because it can never <i>be</i> certain.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"135#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You, then, have two conflicting evaluations of yourself in your mind, and they cannot both be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not yet realize how completely different these evaluations are, because you do not understand how lofty the Holy Spirit’s perception of you really is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is not deceived by anything you do, because He never forgets what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego is deceived by everything you do, especially when you respond to the Holy Spirit, because at such times its confusion increases.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego is, therefore, particularly likely to attack you when you react lovingly, because it has evaluated you as unloving and you are going against its judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego will attack your motives as soon as they become clearly out of accord with its perception of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is when it will shift abruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, since its uncertainty is increased.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet it is surely pointless to attack in return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What can this mean except that you are agreeing with the ego’s evaluation of what you are?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"135#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you choose to see yourself as unloving you will not be happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are condemning yourself and must therefore regard yourself as inadequate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Would you look to the ego to help you escape from a sense of inadequacy it has produced, and must maintain for its existence?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Can you escape from its evaluation of you by using its methods for keeping this picture intact?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"135#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot evaluate an insane belief system from within it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its range precludes this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can only go beyond it, look back from a point where sanity exists and <i>see the contrast.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only by this contrast can insanity be judged as insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>With the grandeur of God in you, you have chosen to be little and to lament your littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Within the system that dictated this choice the lament is inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your littleness is taken for granted there and you do not ask, “Who granted it?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The question is meaningless within the ego’s thought system, because it would open the whole thought system to question.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"135#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have said that the ego does not know what a real question is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Lack of knowledge of any kind is always associated with unwillingness to know, and this produces a total lack of knowledge simply because knowledge is total.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Not to question your littleness therefore is to deny all knowledge, and keep the ego’s whole thought system intact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot retain part of a thought system, because it can be questioned only at its foundation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this must be questioned from beyond it, because within it its foundation does stand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit judges against the reality of the ego’s thought system merely because He knows its foundation is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Therefore, nothing that arises from it means anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He judges every belief you hold in terms of where it comes from.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If it comes from God, He knows it to be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If it does not, He knows that it is meaningless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"135#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whenever you question your value, say:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"135#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God Himself is incomplete without me.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"135#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember this when the ego speaks, and you will not hear it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The truth about you is so lofty that nothing unworthy of God is worthy of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Choose, then, what you want in these terms, and accept nothing that you would not offer to God as wholly fitting for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not want anything else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"135#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Return your part to Him, and He will give you all of Himself in exchange for the return of what belongs to Him and renders Him complete.</span></p></div>
