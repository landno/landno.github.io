data-sentence-id=\"065#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Before miracle workers are ready to undertake their function in this world, it is essential that they fully understand the fear of release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Otherwise they may unwittingly foster the belief that release is imprisonment, a belief that is already very prevalent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This misperception arises in turn from the belief that harm can be limited to the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is because of the underlying fear that the mind can hurt itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>None of these errors is meaningful, because the miscreations of the mind do not really exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This recognition is a far better protective device than any form of level confusion, because it introduces correction at the level of the error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is essential to remember that only the mind can create, and that correction belongs at the thought level.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To amplify an earlier statement, spirit is already perfect and therefore does not require correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The body does not exist except as a learning device for the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This learning device is not subject to errors of its own, because it cannot create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It is obvious, then, that inducing the mind to give up its miscreations is the only application of creative ability that is truly meaningful.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"065#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Magic is the mindless or the miscreative use of mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Physical medications are forms of “spells,” but if you are afraid to use the mind to heal, you should not attempt to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The very fact that you are afraid makes your mind vulnerable to miscreation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are therefore likely to misunderstand any healing that might occur, and because egocentricity and fear usually occur together, you may be unable to accept the real Source of the healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Under these conditions, it is safer for you to rely temporarily on physical healing devices, because you cannot misperceive them as your own creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As long as your sense of vulnerability persists, you should not attempt to perform miracles.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"065#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have already said that miracles are expressions of miracle-mindedness, and miracle-mindedness means right-mindedness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The right-minded neither exalt nor depreciate the mind of the miracle worker or the miracle receiver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>However, as a correction, the miracle need not await the right-mindedness of the receiver.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In fact, its purpose is to restore him <i>to</i> his right mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is essential, however, that the miracle worker be in his right mind, however briefly, or he will be unable to re-establish right-mindedness in someone else.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"065#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The healer who relies on his own readiness is endangering his understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are perfectly safe as long as you are completely unconcerned about your readiness, but maintain a consistent trust in mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If your miracle working inclinations are not functioning properly, it is always because fear has intruded on your right-mindedness and has turned it upside down.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All forms of not-right-mindedness are the result of refusal to accept the Atonement for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you do accept it, you are in a position to recognize that those who need healing are simply those who have not realized that right-mindedness <i>is</i> healing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"065#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span><i>The sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This means you recognize that mind is the only creative level, and that its errors are healed by the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Once you accept this, your mind can only heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By denying your mind any destructive potential and reinstating its purely constructive powers, you place yourself in a position to undo the level confusion of others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The message you then give to them is the truth that their minds are similarly constructive, and their miscreations cannot hurt them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>By affirming this you release the mind from overevaluating its own learning device, and restore the mind to its true position as the learner.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"065#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It should be emphasized again that the body does not learn any more than it creates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As a learning device it merely follows the learner, but if it is falsely endowed with self-initiative, it becomes a serious obstruction to the very learning it should facilitate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only the mind is capable of illumination.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Spirit is already illuminated and the body in itself is too dense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The mind, however, can bring its illumination to the body by recognizing that it is not the learner, and is therefore unamenable to learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The body is, however, easily brought into alignment with a mind that has learned to look beyond it toward the light.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"065#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Corrective learning always begins with the awakening of spirit, and the turning away from the belief in physical sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This often entails fear, because you are afraid of what your spiritual sight will show you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I said before that the Holy Spirit cannot see error, and is capable only of looking beyond it to the defense of Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no doubt that this may produce discomfort, yet the discomfort is not the final outcome of the perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When the Holy Spirit is permitted to look upon the defilement of the altar, He also looks immediately toward the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing He perceives can induce fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Everything that results from spiritual awareness is merely channelized toward correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Discomfort is aroused only to bring the need for correction into awareness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"065#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The fear of healing arises in the end from an unwillingness to accept unequivocally that healing is necessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What the physical eye sees is not corrective, nor can error be corrected by any device that can be seen physically.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As long as you believe in what your physical sight tells you, your attempts at correction will be misdirected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The real vision is obscured, because you cannot endure to see your own defiled altar.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But since the altar has been defiled, your state becomes doubly dangerous unless it <i>is</i> perceived.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"065#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing is an ability that developed after the separation, before which it was unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Like all aspects of the belief in space and time, it is temporary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>However, as long as time persists, healing is needed as a means of protection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is because healing rests on charity, and charity is a way of perceiving the perfection of another even if you cannot perceive it in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Most of the loftier concepts of which you are capable now are time-dependent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Charity is really a weaker reflection of a much more powerful love-encompassment that is far beyond any form of charity you can conceive of as yet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Charity is essential to right-mindedness in the limited sense in which it can now be attained.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"065#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Charity is a way of looking at another as if he had already gone far beyond his actual accomplishments in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Since his own thinking is faulty he cannot see the Atonement for himself, or he would have no need of charity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The charity that is accorded him is both an acknowledgment that he needs help, and a recognition that he will accept it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Both of these perceptions clearly imply their dependence on time, making it apparent that charity still lies within the limitations of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I said before that only revelation transcends time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The miracle, as an expression of charity, can only shorten it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It must be understood, however, that whenever you offer a miracle to another, you are shortening the suffering of both of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"065#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This corrects retroactively as well as progressively.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Before miracle workers are ready to undertake their function in this world, it is essential that they fully
