<span data-sentence-id=\"125#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Attack is always physical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When attack in any form enters your mind you are equating yourself with a body, since this is the ego’s interpretation of the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not have to attack physically to accept this interpretation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are accepting it simply by the belief that attack can get you something you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you did not believe this, the idea of attack would have no appeal for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you equate yourself with a body you will always experience depression.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When a child of God thinks of himself in this way he is belittling himself, and seeing his brothers as similarly belittled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Since he can find himself only in them, he has cut himself off from salvation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember that the Holy Spirit interprets the body only as a means of communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Being the Communication Link between God and His separated Sons, the Holy Spirit interprets everything you have made in the light of what He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego separates through the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit reaches through it to others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not perceive your brothers as the Holy Spirit does, because you do not regard bodies solely as a means of joining minds and uniting them with yours and mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This interpretation of the body will change your mind entirely about its value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Of itself it has none.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you use the body for attack, it is harmful to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you use it only to reach the minds of those who believe they are bodies, and teach them <i>through</i> the body that this is not so, you will understand the power of the mind that is in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you use the body for this and only for this, you cannot use it for attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the service of uniting it becomes a beautiful lesson in communion, which has value until communion <i>is.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is God’s way of making unlimited what you have limited.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit does not see the body as you do, because He knows the only reality of anything is the service it renders God on behalf of the function He gives it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Communication ends separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Attack promotes it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body is beautiful or ugly, peaceful or savage, helpful or harmful, according to the use to which it is put.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And in the body of another you will see the use to which you have put yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If the body becomes a means you give to the Holy Spirit to use on behalf of union of the Sonship, you will not see anything physical except as what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Use it for truth and you will see it truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Misuse it and you will misunderstand it, because you have already done so <i>by</i> misusing it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Interpret anything apart from the Holy Spirit and you will mistrust it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This will lead you to hatred and attack and loss of peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet all loss comes only from your own misunderstanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Loss of any kind is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But when you look upon a brother as a physical entity, his power and glory are “lost” to you and so are yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have attacked him, but you must have attacked yourself first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not see him this way for your own salvation, which must bring him his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not allow him to belittle himself in your mind, but give him freedom from his belief in littleness, and thus escape from yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As part of you, he is holy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>As part of me, you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To communicate with part of God Himself is to reach beyond the Kingdom to its Creator, through His Voice which He has established as part of you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Rejoice, then, that of yourself you can do nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are not <i>of</i> yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He of Whom you are has willed your power and glory for you, with which you can perfectly accomplish His holy Will for you when you accept it for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has not withdrawn His gifts from you, but you believe you have withdrawn them from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let no Son of God remain hidden for His Name’s sake, because His Name is yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Bible says, “The Word (or thought) was made flesh.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Strictly speaking this is impossible, since it seems to involve the translation of one order of reality into another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Different orders of reality merely appear to exist, just as different orders of miracles do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thought cannot be made into flesh except by belief, since thought is not physical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet thought is communication, for which the body can be used.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the only natural use to which it can be put.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To use the body unnaturally is to lose sight of the Holy Spirit’s purpose, and thus to confuse the goal of His curriculum.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is nothing so frustrating to a learner as a curriculum he cannot learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His sense of adequacy suffers, and he must become depressed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Being faced with an impossible learning situation is the most depressing thing in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In fact, it is ultimately why the world itself is depressing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit’s curriculum is never depressing, because it is a curriculum of joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Whenever the reaction to learning is depression, it is because the true goal of the curriculum has been lost sight of.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this world, not even the body is perceived as whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Its purpose is seen as fragmented into many functions with little or no relationship to each other, so that it appears to be ruled by chaos.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Guided by the ego, it <i>is.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Guided by the Holy Spirit, it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It becomes a means by which the part of the mind you tried to separate <i>from</i> spirit can reach beyond its distortions and return <i>to</i> spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego’s temple thus becomes the temple of the Holy Spirit, where devotion to Him replaces devotion to the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In this sense the body does become a temple to God; His Voice abides in it by directing the use to which it is put.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing is the result of using the body solely for communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Since this is natural it heals by making whole, which is also natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All mind is whole, and the belief that part of it is physical, or not mind, is a fragmented or sick interpretation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Mind cannot be made physical, but it can be made manifest <i>through</i> the physical if it uses the body to go beyond itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>By reaching out, the mind extends itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It does not stop at the body, for if it does it is blocked in its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>A mind that has been blocked has allowed itself to be vulnerable to attack, because it has turned against itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The removal of blocks, then, is the only way to guarantee help and healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Help and healing are the normal expressions of a mind that is working through the body, but not <i>in</i> it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If the mind believes the body is its goal it will distort its perception of the body, and by blocking its own extension beyond it, will induce illness by fostering separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perceiving the body as a separate entity cannot but foster illness, because it is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A medium of communication loses its usefulness if it is used for anything else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To use a medium of communication as a medium of attack is an obvious confusion in purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To communicate is to join and to attack is to separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How can you do both simultaneously with the same thing and not suffer?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Perception of the body can be unified only by one purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This releases the mind from the temptation to see the body in many lights, and gives it over entirely to the One Light in which it can be really understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To confuse a learning device with a curriculum goal is a fundamental confusion that blocks the understanding of both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Learning must lead beyond the body to the re-establishment of the power of the mind in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This can be accomplished only if the mind extends to other minds, and does not arrest itself in its extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This arrest is the cause of all illness, because only extension is the mind’s function.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The opposite of joy is depression.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When your learning promotes depression instead of joy, you cannot be listening to God’s joyous Teacher and learning His lessons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To see a body as anything except a means of communication is to limit your mind and to hurt yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Health is therefore nothing more than united purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If the body is brought under the purpose of the mind, it becomes whole because the mind’s purpose is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Attack can only be an assumed purpose of the body, because apart from the mind the body has no purpose at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are not limited by the body, and thought cannot be made flesh.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet mind can be manifested through the body if it goes beyond it and does not interpret it as limitation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whenever you see another as limited to or by the body, you are imposing this limit on yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Are you willing to accept this, when your whole purpose for learning should be to escape from limitations?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To conceive of the body as a means of attack and to believe that joy could possibly result, is a clear-cut indication of a poor learner.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He has accepted a learning goal in obvious contradiction to the unified purpose of the curriculum, and one that is interfering with his ability to accept its purpose as his own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Joy is unified purpose, and unified purpose is only God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When yours is unified it is His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Believe you can interfere with His purpose, and you need salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have condemned yourself, but condemnation is not of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore it is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No more are any of its seeming results.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When you see a brother as a body, you are condemning him because you have condemned yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#15:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet if all condemnation is unreal, and it must be unreal since it is a form of attack, then it can <i>have</i> no results.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"125#16\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">16.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#16:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not allow yourself to suffer from imagined results of what is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Free your mind from the belief that this is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In its complete impossibility lies your only hope for release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But what other hope would you want?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#16:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Freedom from illusions lies only in not believing them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#16:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no attack, but there <i>is</i> unlimited communication and therefore unlimited power and wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#16:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The power of wholeness is extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"125#16:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not arrest your thought in this world, and you will open your mind to creation in God.</span></p></div>
