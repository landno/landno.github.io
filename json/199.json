data-sentence-id=\"199#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is in your power, in time, to delay the perfect union of the Father and the Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For in this world, the attraction of guilt does stand between them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Neither time nor season means anything in eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But here it is the Holy Spirit’s function to use them both, though not as the ego uses them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the season when you would celebrate my birth into the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet you know not how to do it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Let the Holy Spirit teach you, and let me celebrate <i>your</i> birth through Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The only gift I can accept of you is the gift I gave to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Release me as I choose your own release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The time of Christ we celebrate together, for it has no meaning if we are apart.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"199#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy instant is truly the time of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For in this liberating instant no guilt is laid upon the Son of God, and his unlimited power is thus restored to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What other gift can you offer me, when only this I choose to offer you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And to see me is to see me in everyone, and offer everyone the gift you offer me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I am as incapable of receiving sacrifice as God is, and every sacrifice you ask of yourself you ask of me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Learn now that sacrifice of any kind is nothing but a limitation imposed on giving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And by this limitation you have limited acceptance of the gift I offer you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"199#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We who are one cannot give separately.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you are willing to accept our relationship as real, guilt will hold no attraction for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For in our union you will accept all of our brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The gift of union is the only gift that I was born to give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Give it to me, that you may have it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The time of Christ is the time appointed for the gift of freedom, offered to everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And by your acceptance of it, you offer it to everyone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"199#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is in your power to make this season holy, for it is in your power to make the time of Christ be now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is possible to do this all at once because there is but one shift in perception that is necessary, for you made but one mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It seems like many, but it is all the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For though the ego takes many forms, it is always the same idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is not love is always fear, and nothing else.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"199#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is not necessary to follow fear through all the circuitous routes by which it burrows underground and hides in darkness, to emerge in forms quite different from what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it <i>is</i> necessary to examine each one as long as you would retain the principle that governs all of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you are willing to regard them, not as separate, but as different manifestations of the same idea, and one you do not want, they go together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The idea is simply this: You believe it is possible to be host to the ego or hostage to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the choice you think you have, and the decision you believe that you must make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You see no other alternatives, for you cannot accept the fact that sacrifice gets nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Sacrifice is so essential to your thought system that salvation apart from sacrifice means nothing to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your confusion of sacrifice and love is so profound that you cannot conceive of love without sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And it is this that you must look upon; sacrifice is attack, not love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If you would accept but this one idea, your fear of love would vanish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Guilt cannot last when the idea of sacrifice has been removed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>For if there is sacrifice, someone must pay and someone must get.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>And the only question that remains is how much is the price, and for getting what.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"199#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As host to the ego, you believe that you can give all your guilt away whenever you want, and thereby purchase peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And the payment does not seem to be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>While it is obvious that the ego does demand payment it never seems to be demanding it of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are unwilling to recognize that the ego, which you invited, is treacherous only to those who think they are its host.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego will never let you perceive this, since this recognition would make it homeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For when the recognition dawns clearly, you will not be deceived by any form the ego takes to protect itself from your sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Each form will be recognized as but a cover for the one idea that hides behind them all; that love demands sacrifice, and is therefore inseparable from attack and fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And that guilt is the price of love, which must be paid by fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"199#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How fearful, then, has God become to you, and how great a sacrifice do you believe His Love demands!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For total love would demand total sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so the ego seems to demand less of you than God, and of the two is judged as the lesser of two evils, one to be feared a little, perhaps, but the other to be destroyed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you see love as destructive, and your only question is who is to be destroyed, you or another?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You seek to answer this question in your special relationships, in which you seem to be both destroyer and destroyed in part, but able to be neither completely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And this you think saves you from God, Whose total Love would completely destroy you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"199#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You think that everyone outside yourself demands your sacrifice, but you do not see that only you demand sacrifice, and only of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the demand of sacrifice is so savage and so fearful that you cannot accept it where it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The real price of not accepting this has been so great that you have given God away rather than look at it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For if God would demand total sacrifice of you, it seems safer to project Him outward and away from you, and not be host to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To Him you ascribed the ego’s treachery, inviting it to take His place to protect you from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you do not recognize that it is what you invited in that would destroy you, and does demand total sacrifice of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No partial sacrifice will appease this savage guest, for it is an invader who but seems to offer kindness, but always to make the sacrifice complete.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"199#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will not succeed in being partial hostage to the ego, for it keeps no bargains and would leave you nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor can you be partial host to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You must choose between total freedom and total bondage, for there are no alternatives but these.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have tried many compromises in the attempt to avoid recognizing the one decision you must make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And yet it is the recognition of the decision, <i>just as it is,</i> that makes the decision so easy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Salvation is simple, being of God, and therefore very easy to understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not try to project it from you and see it outside yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"199#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In you are both the question and the answer; the demand for sacrifice and the peace of God.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is in your power, in time, to delay the perfect union of the Father and the Son.
