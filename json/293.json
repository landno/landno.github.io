data-sentence-id=\"293#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What can it be but arrogance to think your little errors cannot be undone by Heaven’s justice?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what could this mean except that they are sins and not mistakes, forever uncorrectable, and to be met with vengeance, not with justice?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Are you willing to be released from all effects of sin?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot answer this until you see all that the answer must entail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For if you answer “yes” it means you will forego all values of this world in favor of the peace of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Not one sin would you retain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And not one doubt that this is possible will you hold dear that sin be kept in place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You mean that truth has greater value now than all illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And you recognize that truth must be revealed to you, because you know not what it is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"293#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To give reluctantly is not to gain the gift, because you are reluctant to accept it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is saved for you until reluctance to receive it disappears, and you are willing it be given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s justice warrants gratitude, not fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nothing you give is lost to you or anyone, but cherished and preserved in Heaven, where all of the treasures given to God’s Son are kept for him, and offered anyone who but holds out his hand in willingness they be received.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor is the treasure less as it is given out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Each gift but adds to the supply.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For God is fair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He does not fight against His Son’s reluctance to perceive salvation as a gift from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet would His justice not be satisfied until it is received by everyone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"293#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be certain any answer to a problem the Holy Spirit solves will always be one in which no one loses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this must be true, because He asks no sacrifice of anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>An answer which demands the slightest loss to anyone has not resolved the problem, but has added to it and made it greater, harder to resolve and more unfair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is impossible the Holy Spirit could see unfairness as a resolution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To Him, what is unfair must be corrected <i>because</i> it is unfair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And every error is a perception in which one, at least, is seen unfairly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Thus is justice not accorded to the Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>When anyone is seen as losing, he has been condemned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And punishment becomes his due instead of justice.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"293#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The sight of innocence makes punishment impossible, and justice sure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit’s perception leaves no ground for an attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only a loss could justify attack, and loss of any kind He cannot see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The world solves problems in another way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It sees a resolution as a state in which it is decided who shall win and who shall lose; how much the one shall take, and how much can the loser still defend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet does the problem still remain unsolved, for only justice can set up a state in which there is no loser; no one left unfairly treated and deprived, and thus with grounds for vengeance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Problem solving cannot be vengeance, which at best can bring another problem added to the first, in which the murder is not obvious.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"293#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s problem solving is the way in which the problem ends.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has been solved because it has been met with justice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Until it has it will recur, because it has not yet been solved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The principle that justice means no one can lose is crucial to this course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For miracles depend on justice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Not as it is seen through this world’s eyes, but as God knows it and as knowledge is reflected in the sight the Holy Spirit gives.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"293#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one deserves to lose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what would be unjust to him cannot occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Healing must be for everyone, because he does not merit an attack of any kind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What order can there be in miracles, unless someone deserves to suffer more and others less?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And is this justice to the wholly innocent?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A miracle <i>is</i> justice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is not a special gift to some, to be withheld from others as less worthy, more condemned, and thus apart from healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Who is there who can be separate from salvation, if its purpose is the end of specialness?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Where is salvation’s justice if some errors are unforgivable, and warrant vengeance in place of healing and return of peace?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"293#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation cannot seek to help God’s Son be more unfair than he has sought to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If miracles, the Holy Spirit’s gift, were given specially to an elect and special group, and kept apart from others as less deserving, then is He ally to specialness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What He cannot perceive He bears no witness to.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And everyone is equally entitled to His gift of healing and deliverance and peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To give a problem to the Holy Spirit to solve for you means that you <i>want</i> it solved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To keep it for yourself to solve without His help is to decide it should remain unsettled, unresolved, and lasting in its power of injustice and attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one can be unjust to you, unless you have decided first to <i>be</i> unjust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And then must problems rise to block your way, and peace be scattered by the winds of hate.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"293#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Unless you think that all your brothers have an equal right to miracles with you, you will not claim your right to them because you were unjust to one with equal rights.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Seek to deny and you will feel denied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Seek to deprive, and you have been deprived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A miracle can never be received because another could receive it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only forgiveness offers miracles.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And pardon must be just to everyone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"293#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The little problems that you keep and hide become your secret sins, because you did not choose to let them be removed for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so they gather dust and grow, until they cover everything that you perceive and leave you fair to no one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Not one right do you believe you have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And bitterness, with vengeance justified and mercy lost, condemns you as unworthy of forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The unforgiven have no mercy to bestow upon another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is why your sole responsibility must be to take forgiveness for yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"293#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle that you receive, you give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each one becomes an illustration of the law on which salvation rests; that justice must be done to all, if anyone is to be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one can lose, and everyone must benefit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Each miracle is an example of what justice can accomplish when it is offered to everyone alike.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is received and given equally.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is awareness that giving and receiving are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Because it does not make the same unlike, it sees no differences where none exists.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And thus it is the same for everyone, because it sees no differences in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"293#10:9\"><span
