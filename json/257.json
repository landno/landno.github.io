data-sentence-id=\"257#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Reason cannot see sin but can see errors, and leads to their correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not value <i>them,</i> but their correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Reason will also tell you that when you think you sin, you call for help.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet if you will not accept the help you call for, you will not believe that it is yours to give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so you will not give it, thus maintaining the belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For uncorrected error of any kind deceives you about the power that is in you to make correction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If it can correct, and you allow it not to do so, you deny it to yourself and to your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And if he shares this same belief you both will think that you are damned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This you could spare him and yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For reason would not make way for correction in you alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Correction cannot be accepted or refused by you without your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Sin would maintain it can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet reason tells you that you cannot see your brother or yourself as sinful and still perceive the other innocent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who looks upon himself as guilty and sees a sinless world?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And who can see a sinful world and look upon himself apart from it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Sin would maintain you and your brother must be separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But reason tells you that this must be wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you and your brother are joined, how could it be that you have private thoughts?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And how could thoughts that enter into what but seems like yours alone have no effect at all on what <i>is</i> yours?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If minds are joined, this is impossible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one can think but for himself, as God thinks not without His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only were Both in bodies could this be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor could one mind think only for itself unless the body <i>were</i> the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For only bodies can be separate, and therefore unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The home of madness cannot be the home of reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it is easy to leave the home of madness if you see reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You do not leave insanity by going somewhere else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You leave it simply by accepting reason where madness was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Madness and reason see the same things, but it is certain that they look upon them differently.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Madness is an attack on reason that drives it out of mind, and takes its place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Reason does not attack, but takes the place of madness quietly, replacing madness if it be the choice of the insane to listen to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But the insane know not their will, for they believe they see the body, and let their madness tell them it is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Reason would be incapable of this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And if you would defend the body against your reason, you will not understand the body or yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body does not separate you from your brother, and if you think it does you are insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But madness has a purpose, and believes it also has the means to make its purpose real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To see the body as a barrier between what reason tells you must be joined must be insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor could you see it, if you heard the voice of reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What can there be that stands between what is continuous?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if there is nothing in between, how can what enters part be kept away from other parts?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Reason would tell you this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But think what you must recognize, if it be so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you choose sin instead of healing, you would condemn the Son of God to what can never be corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You tell him, by your choice, that he is damned; separate from you and from his Father forever, without a hope of safe return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You teach him this, and you will learn of him exactly what you taught.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you can teach him only that he is as you would have him, and what you choose he be is but your choice for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet think not this is fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That you are joined to him is but a fact, not an interpretation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How can a fact be fearful unless it disagrees with what you hold more dear than truth?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Reason will tell you that this fact is your release.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Neither your brother nor yourself can be attacked alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But neither can accept a miracle instead without the other being blessed by it, and healed of pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Reason, like love, would reassure you, and seeks not to frighten you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The power to heal the Son of God is given you because he must be one with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You <i>are</i> responsible for how he sees himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And reason tells you it is given you to change his whole mind, which is one with you, in just an instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And any instant serves to bring complete correction of his errors and make him whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The instant that you choose to let yourself be healed, in that same instant is his whole salvation seen as complete with yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Reason is given you to understand that this is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For reason, kind as is the purpose for which it is the means, leads steadily away from madness toward the goal of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And here you will lay down the burden of denying truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span><i>This</i> is the burden that is terrible, and not the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That you and your brother are joined is your salvation; the gift of Heaven, not the gift of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Does Heaven seem to be a burden to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In madness, yes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet what madness sees must be dispelled by reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Reason assures you Heaven is what you want, and all you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Listen to Him Who speaks with reason, and brings your reason into line with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Be willing to let reason be the means by which He would direct you how to leave insanity behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Hide not behind insanity in order to escape from reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What madness would conceal, the Holy Spirit still holds out for everyone to look upon with gladness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You <i>are</i> your brother’s savior.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Reason speaks happily indeed of this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This gracious plan was given love by Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what Love plans is like Itself in this: Being united, It would have you learn what you must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And being one with It, it must be given you to give what It has given, and gives still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Spend but an instant in the glad acceptance of what is given you to give your brother, and learn with him what has been given both of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To give is no more blessed than to receive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>But neither is it less.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Son of God is always blessed as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And as his gratitude goes out to you who blessed him, reason will tell you that it cannot be you stand apart from blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The gratitude he offers you reminds you of the thanks your Father gives you for completing Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And here alone does reason tell you that you can understand what you must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your Father is as close to you as is your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet what is there that could be nearer you than is your Self?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"257#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The power you have over the Son of God is not a threat to his reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It but attests to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Where could his freedom lie but in himself, if he be free already?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And who could bind him but himself, if he deny his freedom?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God is not mocked; no more His Son can be imprisoned save by his own desire.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And it is by his own desire that he is freed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Such is his strength, and not his weakness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is at his own mercy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And where he chooses to be merciful, there is he free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"257#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But where he chooses to condemn instead, there is he held a prisoner, waiting in chains his pardon on himself to set him free.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Reason cannot see sin but can see errors, and leads to their correction.
