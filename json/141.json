data-sentence-id=\"141#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have not attacked God and you do love Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can you change your reality?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one can will to destroy himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you think you are attacking yourself, it is a sure sign that you hate what you <i>think</i> you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this, and only this, can be attacked by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What you think you are can be very hateful, and what this strange image makes you do can be very destructive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet the destruction is no more real than the image, although those who make idols do worship them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The idols are nothing, but their worshippers are the Sons of God in sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>God would have them released from their sickness and returned to His Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He will not limit your power to help them, because He has given it to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Do not be afraid of it, because it is your salvation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What Comforter can there be for the sick children of God except His power through you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Remember that it does not matter where in the Sonship He is accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is always accepted for all, and when your mind receives Him the remembrance of Him awakens throughout the Sonship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Heal your brothers simply by accepting God for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your minds are not separate, and God has only one channel for healing because He has but one Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God’s remaining Communication Link with all His children joins them together, and them to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To be aware of this is to heal them because it is the awareness that no one is separate, and so no one is sick.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To believe that a Son of God can be sick is to believe that part of God can suffer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love cannot suffer, because it cannot attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The remembrance of love therefore brings invulnerability with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not side with sickness in the presence of a Son of God even if he believes in it, for your acceptance of God in him acknowledges the Love of God he has forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your recognition of him as part of God reminds him of the truth about himself, which he is denying.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Would you strengthen his denial of God and thus lose sight of yourself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Or would you remind him of his wholeness and remember your Creator with him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To believe a Son of God is sick is to worship the same idol he does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God created love, not idolatry.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All forms of idolatry are caricatures of creation, taught by sick minds too divided to know that creation shares power and never usurps it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Sickness is idolatry, because it is the belief that power can be taken from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet this is impossible, because you are part of God, Who is all power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A sick god must be an idol, made in the image of what its maker thinks he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And that is exactly what the ego does perceive in a Son of God; a sick god, self-created, self-sufficient, very vicious and very vulnerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Is this the idol you would worship?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Is this the image you would be vigilant to save?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Are you really afraid of losing this?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Look calmly at the logical conclusion of the ego’s thought system and judge whether its offering is really what you want, for this <i>is</i> what it offers you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To obtain this you are willing to attack the Divinity of your brothers, and thus lose sight of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you are willing to keep it hidden, to protect an idol you think will save you from the dangers for which it stands, but which do not exist.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There are no idolaters in the Kingdom, but there is great appreciation for everything that God created, because of the calm knowledge that each one is part of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God’s Son knows no idols, but he does know his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Health in this world is the counterpart of value in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not my merit that I contribute to you but my love, for you do not value yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When you do not value yourself you become sick, but my value of you can heal you, because the value of God’s Son is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When I said, “My peace I give unto you,” I meant it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Peace comes from God through me to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is for you although you may not ask for it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When a brother is sick it is because he is not asking for peace, and therefore does not know he has it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The acceptance of peace is the denial of illusion, and sickness <i>is</i> an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet every Son of God has the power to deny illusions anywhere in the Kingdom, merely by denying them completely in himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I can heal you because I know you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I know your value for you, and it is this value that makes you whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A whole mind is not idolatrous, and does not know of conflicting laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I will heal you merely because I have only one message, and it is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your faith in it will make you whole when you have faith in me.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I do not bring God’s message with deception, and you will learn this as you learn that you always receive as much as you accept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You could accept peace now for everyone, and offer them perfect freedom from all illusions because you heard His Voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But have no other gods before Him or you will not hear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God is not jealous of the gods you make, but you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You would save them and serve them, because you believe that they made you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You think they are your father, because you are projecting onto them the fearful fact that you made them to replace God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet when they seem to speak to you, remember that nothing can replace God, and whatever replacements you have attempted are nothing.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Very simply, then, you may believe you are afraid of nothingness, but you are really afraid of nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And in that awareness you are healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will hear the god you listen to.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You made the god of sickness, and by making him you made yourself able to hear him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you did not create him, because he is not the Will of the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is therefore not eternal and will be unmade for you the instant you signify your willingness to accept only the eternal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If God has but one Son, there is but one God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You share reality with Him, because reality is not divided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To accept other gods before Him is to place other images before yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do not realize how much you listen to your gods, and how vigilant you are on their behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet they exist only because you honor them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Place honor where it is due, and peace will be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is your inheritance from your real Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You cannot make your Father, and the father you made did not make you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Honor is not due to illusions, for to honor them is to honor nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet fear is not due them either, for nothing cannot be fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#10:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You have chosen to fear love because of its perfect harmlessness, and because of this fear you have been willing to give up your own perfect helpfulness and your own perfect Help.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"141#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only at the altar of God will you find peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this altar is in you because God put it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Voice still calls you to return, and He will be heard when you place no other gods before Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can give up the god of sickness for your brothers; in fact, you would have to do so if you give him up for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For if you see the god of sickness anywhere, you have accepted him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if you accept him you will bow down and worship him, because he was made as God’s replacement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He is the belief that you can choose which god is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"141#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Although it is clear this has nothing to do with reality, it is equally clear that it has everything to do with reality as you perceive it.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You have not attacked God and you do love Him.
