data-sentence-id=\"496#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea for today is an extension of the previous one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not think of light in terms of strength, and darkness in terms of weakness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is because your idea of what seeing means is tied up with the body and its eyes and brain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus you believe that you can change what you see by putting little bits of glass before your eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is among the many magical beliefs that come from the conviction you are a body, and the body‚Äôs eyes can see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You also believe the body‚Äôs brain can think.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you but understood the nature of thought, you could but laugh at this insane idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is as if you thought you held the match that lights the sun and gives it all its warmth; or that you held the world within your hand, securely bound until you let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet this is no more foolish than to believe the body‚Äôs eyes can see; the brain can think.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is God‚Äôs strength in you that is the light in which you see, as it is His Mind with which you think.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His strength denies your weakness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is your weakness that sees through the body‚Äôs eyes, peering about in darkness to behold the likeness of itself; the small, the weak, the sickly and the dying, those in need, the helpless and afraid, the sad, the poor, the starving and the joyless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>These are seen through eyes that cannot see and cannot bless.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Strength overlooks these things by seeing past appearances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It keeps its steady gaze upon the light that lies beyond them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It unites with light, of which it is a part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It sees itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It brings the light in which your Self appears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In darkness you perceive a self that is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Strength is the truth about you; weakness is an idol falsely worshipped and adored that strength may be dispelled, and darkness rule where God appointed that there should be light.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Strength comes from truth, and shines with light its Source has given it; weakness reflects the darkness of its maker.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is sick and looks on sickness, which is like itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Truth is a savior and can only will for happiness and peace for everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It gives its strength to everyone who asks, in limitless supply.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It sees that lack in anyone would be a lack in all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And so it gives its light that all may see and benefit as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Its strength is shared, that it may bring to all the miracle in which they will unite in purpose and forgiveness and in love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Weakness, which looks in darkness, cannot see a purpose in forgiveness and in love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It sees all others different from itself, and nothing in the world that it would share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It judges and condemns, but does not love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In darkness it remains to hide itself, and dreams that it is strong and conquering, a victor over limitations that but grow in darkness to enormous size.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It fears and it attacks and hates itself, and darkness covers everything it sees, leaving its dreams as fearful as itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No miracles are here, but only hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It separates itself from what it sees, while light and strength perceive themselves as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The light of strength is not the light you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It does not change and flicker and go out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It does not shift from night to day, and back to darkness till the morning comes again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The light of strength is constant, sure as love, forever glad to give itself away, because it cannot give but to itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one can ask in vain to share its sight, and none who enters its abode can leave without a miracle before his eyes, and strength and light abiding in his heart.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The strength in you will offer you the light, and guide your seeing so you do not dwell on idle shadows that the body‚Äôs eyes provide for self-deception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Strength and light unite in you, and where they meet, your Self stands ready to embrace you as Its Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Such is the meeting place we try today to find and rest in, for the peace of God is where your Self, His Son, is waiting now to meet Itself again, and be as one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us give twenty minutes twice today to join this meeting.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let yourself be brought unto your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its strength will be the light in which the gift of sight is given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Leave, then, the dark a little while today, and we will practice seeing in the light, closing the body‚Äôs eyes and asking truth to show us how to find the meeting place of self and Self, where light and strength are one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"496#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Morning and evening we will practice thus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>After the morning meeting, we will use the day in preparation for the time at night when we will meet again in trust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let us repeat as often as we can the idea for today, and recognize that we are being introduced to sight, and led away from darkness to the light where only miracles can be perceived.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The idea for today is an extension of the previous one.
