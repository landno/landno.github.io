data-sentence-id=\"126#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Attitudes toward the body are attitudes toward attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego’s definitions of anything are childish, and are always based on what it believes the thing is <i>for.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is because it is incapable of true generalizations, and equates what it sees with the function it ascribes to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not equate it with what it <i>is.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To the ego the body is to attack <i>with.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Equating you with the body, it teaches that <i>you</i> are to attack with.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The body, then, is not the source of its own health.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The body’s condition lies solely in your interpretation of its function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Functions are part of being since they arise from it, but the relationship is not reciprocal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The whole does define the part, but the part does not define the whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Yet to know in part is to know entirely because of the fundamental difference between knowledge and perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>In perception the whole is built up of parts that can separate and reassemble in different constellations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>But knowledge never changes, so its constellation is permanent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>The idea of part-whole relationships has meaning only at the level of perception, where change is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#1:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>Otherwise, there is no difference between the part and whole.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"126#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body exists in a world that seems to contain two voices fighting for its possession.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this perceived constellation the body is seen as capable of shifting its allegiance from one to the other, making the concepts of both health and sickness meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego makes a fundamental confusion between means and end as it always does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Regarding the body as an end, the ego has no real use for it because it is <i>not</i> an end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You must have noticed an outstanding characteristic of every end that the ego has accepted as its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you have achieved it, <i>it has not satisfied you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is why the ego is forced to shift ceaselessly from one goal to another, so that you will continue to hope it can yet offer you something.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"126#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It has been particularly difficult to overcome the ego’s belief in the body as an end, because it is synonymous with the belief in attack as an end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego has a profound investment in sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you are sick, how can you object to the ego’s firm belief that you are not invulnerable?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is an appealing argument from the ego’s point of view, because it obscures the obvious attack that underlies the sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you recognized this and also decided against attack, you could not give this false witness to the ego’s stand.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"126#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is hard to perceive sickness as a false witness, because you do not realize that it is entirely out of keeping with what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This witness, then, appears to be innocent and trustworthy because you have not seriously cross-examined him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you had, you would not consider sickness such a strong witness on behalf of the ego’s views.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A more honest statement would be that those who want the ego are predisposed to defend it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore, their choice of witnesses should be suspect from the beginning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego does not call upon witnesses who would disagree with its case, nor does the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I have said that judgment is the function of the Holy Spirit, and one He is perfectly equipped to fulfill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego as a judge gives anything but an impartial judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>When the ego calls on a witness, it has already made the witness an ally.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"126#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is still true that the body has no function of itself, because it is not an end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego, however, establishes it as an end because, as such, its true function is obscured.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the purpose of everything the ego does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its sole aim is to lose sight of the function of everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A sick body does not make any sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It could not make sense because sickness is not what the body is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Sickness is meaningful only if the two basic premises on which the ego’s interpretation of the body rests are true; that the body is for attack, and that you are a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Without these premises sickness is inconceivable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"126#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness is a way of demonstrating that you can be hurt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a witness to your frailty, your vulnerability, and your extreme need to depend on external guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego uses this as its best argument for your need for <i>its</i> guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It dictates endless prescriptions for avoiding catastrophic outcomes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit, perfectly aware of the same situation, does not bother to analyze it at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If data are meaningless there is no point in analyzing them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The function of truth is to collect information that is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span><i>Any</i> way you handle error results in nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The more complicated the results become the harder it may be to recognize their nothingness, but it is not necessary to examine all possible outcomes to which premises give rise in order to judge them truly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"126#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A learning device is not a teacher.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It cannot tell you how you feel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not know how you feel because you have accepted the ego’s confusion, and you therefore believe that a learning device <i>can</i> tell you how you feel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Sickness is merely another example of your insistence on asking guidance of a teacher who does not know the answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego is incapable of knowing how you feel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When I said that the ego does not know anything, I said the one thing about the ego that is wholly true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But there is a corollary; if only knowledge has being and the ego has no knowledge, then the ego has no being.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"126#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You might well ask how the voice of something that does not exist can be so insistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Have you thought about the distorting power of something you want, even if it is not real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There are many instances of how what you want distorts perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one can doubt the ego’s skill in building up false cases.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor can anyone doubt your willingness to listen until you choose not to accept anything except truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you lay the ego aside, it will be gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Holy Spirit’s Voice is as loud as your willingness to listen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It cannot be louder without violating your freedom of choice, which the Holy Spirit seeks to restore, never to undermine.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"126#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit teaches you to use your body only to reach your brothers, so He can teach His message through you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This will heal them and therefore heal you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Everything used in accordance with its function as the Holy Spirit sees it cannot be sick.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everything used otherwise is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Do not allow the body to be a mirror of a split mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not let it be an image of your own perception of littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not let it reflect your decision to attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Health is seen as the natural state of everything when interpretation is left to the Holy Spirit, Who perceives no attack on anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Health is the result of relinquishing all attempts to use the body lovelessly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"126#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Health is the beginning of the proper perspective on life under the guidance of the one Teacher Who knows what life is, being the Voice for Life Itself.</span></p></div>
