data-sentence-id=\"112#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Although you can love the Sonship only as one, you can perceive it as fragmented.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is impossible, however, to see something in part of it that you will not attribute to all of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is why attack is never discrete, and why it must be relinquished entirely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If it is not relinquished entirely it is not relinquished at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Fear and love make or create, depending on whether the ego or the Holy Spirit begets or inspires them, but they <i>will</i> return to the mind of the thinker and they will affect his total perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That includes his concept of God, of His creations and of his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He will not appreciate any of Them if he regards Them fearfully.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He will appreciate all of Them if he regards Them with love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The mind that accepts attack cannot love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is because it believes it can destroy love, and therefore does not understand what love is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If it does not understand what love is, it cannot perceive itself as loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This loses the awareness of being, induces feelings of unreality and results in utter confusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your thinking has done this because of its power, but your thinking can also save you from this because its power is not of your making.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your ability to direct your thinking as you choose is part of its power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you do not believe you can do this you have denied the power of your thought, and thus rendered it powerless in your belief.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ingeniousness of the ego to preserve itself is enormous, but it stems from the very power of the mind the ego denies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This means that the ego attacks what is preserving it, which must result in extreme anxiety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is why the ego never recognizes what it is doing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is perfectly logical but clearly insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego draws upon the one source that is totally inimical to its existence <i>for</i> its existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Fearful of perceiving the power of this source, it is forced to depreciate it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This threatens its own existence, a state which it finds intolerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Remaining logical but still insane, the ego resolves this completely insane dilemma in a completely insane way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It does not perceive <i>its</i> existence as threatened by projecting the threat onto <i>you,</i> and perceiving your being as nonexistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This ensures its continuance if you side with it, by guaranteeing that you will not know your own safety.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego cannot afford to know anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Knowledge is total, and the ego does not believe in totality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This unbelief is its origin, and while the ego does not love you it <i>is</i> faithful to its own antecedents, begetting as it was begotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Mind always reproduces as it was produced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Produced by fear, the ego reproduces fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is its allegiance, and this allegiance makes it treacherous to love because you <i>are</i> love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Love is your power, which the ego must deny.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It must also deny everything this power gives you <i>because</i> it gives you everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>No one who has everything wants the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Its own maker, then, does not want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Rejection is therefore the only decision the ego could possibly encounter, if the mind that made it knew itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And if it recognized any part of the Sonship, it <i>would</i> know itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego therefore opposes all appreciation, all recognition, all sane perception and all knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It perceives their threat as total, because it senses that all commitments the mind makes are total.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forced, therefore, to detach itself from you, it is willing to attach itself to anything else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But there <i>is</i> nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The mind can, however, make up illusions, and if it does so it will believe in them, because that is how it made them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit undoes illusions without attacking them, because He cannot perceive them at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They therefore do not exist for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He resolves the apparent conflict they engender by perceiving conflict as meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I have said before that the Holy Spirit perceives the conflict exactly as it is, and it <i>is</i> meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit does not want you to understand conflict; He wants you to realize that, because conflict is meaningless, it is not understandable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As I have already said, understanding brings appreciation and appreciation brings love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing else can be understood, because nothing else is real and therefore nothing else has meaning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you will keep in mind what the Holy Spirit offers you, you cannot be vigilant for anything <i>but</i> God and His Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The only reason you may find this hard to accept is because you may still think there is something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Belief does not require vigilance unless it is conflicted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If it is, there are conflicting components within it that have led to a state of war, and vigilance has therefore become essential.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Vigilance has no place in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is necessary against beliefs that are not true, and would never have been called upon by the Holy Spirit if you had not believed the untrue.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When you believe something, you have made it true for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>When you believe what God does not know, your thought seems to contradict His, and this makes it appear as if you are attacking Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have repeatedly emphasized that the ego does believe it can attack God, and tries to persuade you that you have done this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If the mind cannot attack, the ego proceeds perfectly logically to the belief that you must be a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By not seeing you as you are, it can see itself as it wants to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Aware of its weakness the ego wants your allegiance, but not as you really are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego therefore wants to engage your mind in its own delusional system, because otherwise the light of your understanding would dispel it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It wants no part of truth, because the ego itself is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If truth is total, the untrue cannot exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Commitment to either must be total; they cannot coexist in your mind without splitting it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>If they cannot coexist in peace, and if you want peace, you must give up the idea of conflict entirely and for all time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This requires vigilance only as long as you do not recognize what is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>While you believe that two totally contradictory thought systems share truth, your need for vigilance is apparent.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your mind is dividing its allegiance between two kingdoms, and you are totally committed to neither.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your identification with the Kingdom is totally beyond question except by you, when you are thinking insanely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What you are is not established by your perception, and is not influenced by it at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perceived problems in identification at any level are not problems of fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are problems of understanding, since their presence implies a belief that what you are is up to you to decide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego believes this totally, being fully committed to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego therefore is totally committed to untruth, perceiving in total contradiction to the Holy Spirit and to the knowledge of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can be perceived with meaning only by the Holy Spirit because your being <i>is</i> the knowledge of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Any belief you accept apart from this will obscure God’s Voice in you, and will therefore obscure God to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Unless you perceive His creation truly you cannot know the Creator, since God and His creation are not separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Oneness of the Creator and the creation is your wholeness, your sanity and your limitless power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This limitless power is God’s gift to you, because it is what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you dissociate your mind from it you are perceiving the most powerful force in the universe as if it were weak, because you do not believe you are part of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perceived without your part in it, God’s creation is seen as weak, and those who see themselves as weakened do attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The attack must be blind, however, because there is nothing to attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Therefore they make up images, perceive them as unworthy and attack them for their unworthiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is all the world of the ego is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It has no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Do not try to understand it because, if you do, you are believing that it can be understood and is therefore capable of being appreciated and loved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That would justify its existence, which cannot be justified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You cannot make the meaningless meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#11:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This can only be an insane attempt.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Allowing insanity to enter your mind means that you have not judged sanity as wholly desirable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you want something else you will make something else, but because it is something else, it will attack your thought system and divide your allegiance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot create in this divided state, and you must be vigilant against this divided state because only peace can be extended.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your divided mind is blocking the extension of the Kingdom; and its extension is your joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you do not extend the Kingdom, you are not thinking with your Creator and creating as He created.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"112#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this depressing state the Holy Spirit reminds you gently that you are sad because you are not fulfilling your function as co-creator with God, and are therefore depriving yourself of joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is not God’s choice but yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If your mind could be out of accord with God’s, you would be willing without meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet because God’s Will is unchangeable, no conflict of will is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the Holy Spirit’s perfectly consistent teaching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Creation, not separation, is your will <i>because</i> it is God’s, and nothing that opposes this means anything at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"112#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Being a perfect accomplishment, the Sonship can only accomplish perfectly, extending the joy in which it was created, and identifying itself with both its Creator and its creations, knowing They are One.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Although you can love the Sonship only as one, you can perceive it as fragmented.
