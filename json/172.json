Knowledge","inlineNumber":"VIII."},"annotation":"T-13.VIII","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-13-sect-8\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All healing is release from the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is why the Holy Spirit is the only Healer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He teaches that the past does not exist, a fact which belongs to the sphere of knowledge, and which therefore no one in the world can know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It would indeed be impossible to be in the world with this knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the mind that knows this unequivocally knows also it dwells in eternity, and utilizes no perception at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It therefore does not consider where it is, because the concept “where” does not mean anything to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It knows that it is everywhere, just as it has everything, and forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The very real difference between perception and knowledge becomes quite apparent if you consider this: There is nothing partial about knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every aspect is whole, and therefore no aspect is separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are an aspect of knowledge, being in the Mind of God, Who knows you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All knowledge must be yours, for in you is all knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perception, at its loftiest, is never complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Even the perception of the Holy Spirit, as perfect as perception can be, is without meaning in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Perception can reach everywhere under His guidance, for the vision of Christ beholds everything in light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet no perception, however holy, will last forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perfect perception, then, has many elements in common with knowledge, making transfer to it possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the last step must be taken by God, because the last step in your redemption, which seems to be in the future, was accomplished by God in your creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The separation has not interrupted it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Creation cannot be interrupted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The separation is merely a faulty formulation of reality, with no effect at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The miracle, without a function in Heaven, is needful here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Aspects of reality can still be seen, and they will replace aspects of unreality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Aspects of reality can be seen in everything and everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet only God can gather them together, by crowning them as one with the final gift of eternity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Apart from the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit has no function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is not separate from Either, being in the Mind of Both, and knowing that Mind is One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is a Thought of God, and God has given Him to you because He has no Thoughts He does not share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His message speaks of timelessness in time, and that is why Christ’s vision looks on everything with love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet even Christ’s vision is not His reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The golden aspects of reality that spring to light under His loving gaze are partial glimpses of the Heaven that lies beyond them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the miracle of creation; <i>that it is one forever.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Every miracle you offer to the Son of God is but the true perception of one aspect of the whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Though every aspect <i>is</i> the whole, you cannot know this until you see that every aspect is the same, perceived in the same light and therefore one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everyone seen without the past thus brings you nearer to the end of time by bringing healed and healing sight into the darkness, and enabling the world to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For light must come into the darkened world to make Christ’s vision possible even here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Help Him to give His gift of light to all who think they wander in the darkness, and let Him gather them into His quiet sight that makes them one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>They are all the same; all beautiful and equal in their holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And He will offer them unto His Father as they were offered unto Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is one miracle, as there is one reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And every miracle you do contains them all, as every aspect of reality you see blends quietly into the one reality of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The only miracle that ever was is God’s most holy Son, created in the one reality that is his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Christ’s vision is His gift to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His Being is His Father’s gift to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be you content with healing, for Christ’s gift you can bestow, and your Father’s gift you cannot lose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Offer Christ’s gift to everyone and everywhere, for miracles, offered the Son of God through the Holy Spirit, attune you to reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit knows your part in the redemption, and who are seeking you and where to find them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Knowledge is far beyond your individual concern.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You who are part of it and all of it need only realize that it is of the Father, not of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your role in the redemption leads you to it by re-establishing its oneness in your mind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you have seen your brothers as yourself you will be released to knowledge, having learned to free yourself through Him Who knows of freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Unite with me under the holy banner of His teaching, and as we grow in strength the power of God’s Son will move in us, and we will leave no one untouched and no one left alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And suddenly time will be over, and we will all unite in the eternity of God the Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The holy light you saw outside yourself, in every miracle you offered to your brothers, will be returned to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And knowing that the light is in you, your creations will be there with you, as you are in your Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As miracles in this world join you to your brothers, so do your creations establish your fatherhood in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are the witness to the Fatherhood of God, and He has given you the power to create the witnesses to yours, which is as His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Deny a brother here, and you deny the witnesses to your fatherhood in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle that God created is perfect, as are the miracles that you established in His Name.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They need no healing, nor do you, when you accept them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"172#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet in this world your perfection is unwitnessed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God knows it, but you do not, and so you do not share His witness to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor do you witness unto Him, for reality is witnessed to as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God waits your witness to His Son and to Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The miracles you do on earth are lifted up to Heaven and to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They witness to what you do not know, and as they reach the gates of Heaven, God will open them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"172#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For never would He leave His Own beloved Son outside them, and beyond Himself.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"All healing is release from the past.
