data-sentence-id=\"299#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A little hindrance can seem large indeed to those who do not understand that miracles are all the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet teaching that is what this course is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is its only purpose, for only that is all there is to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you can learn it in many different ways.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All learning is a help or hindrance to the gate of Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing in between is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There are two teachers only, who point in different ways.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And you will go along the way your chosen teacher leads.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There are but two directions you can take, while time remains and choice is meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For never will another road be made except the way to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You but choose whether to go toward Heaven, or away to nowhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>There is nothing else to choose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing is ever lost but time, which in the end is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it is but a little hindrance to eternity, quite meaningless to the real Teacher of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet since you do believe in it, why should you waste it going nowhere, when it can be used to reach a goal as high as learning can achieve?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Think not the way to Heaven’s gate is difficult at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nothing you undertake with certain purpose and high resolve and happy confidence, holding your brother’s hand and keeping step to Heaven’s song, is difficult to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But it is hard indeed to wander off, alone and miserable, down a road that leads to nothing and that has no purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God gave His Teacher to replace the one you made, not to conflict with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what He would replace has been replaced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Time lasted but an instant in your mind, with no effect upon eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so is all time past, and everything exactly as it was before the way to nothingness was made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The tiny tick of time in which the first mistake was made, and all of them within that one mistake, held also the Correction for that one, and all of them that came within the first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in that tiny instant time was gone, for that was all it ever was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What God gave answer to is answered and is gone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To you who still believe you live in time and know not it is gone, the Holy Spirit still guides you through the infinitely small and senseless maze you still perceive in time, though it has long since gone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You think you live in what is past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each thing you look upon you saw but for an instant, long ago, before its unreality gave way to truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Not one illusion still remains unanswered in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Uncertainty was brought to certainty so long ago that it is hard indeed to hold it to your heart, as if it were before you still.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The tiny instant you would keep and make eternal, passed away in Heaven too soon for anything to notice it had come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What disappeared too quickly to affect the simple knowledge of the Son of God can hardly still be there, for you to choose to be your teacher.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only in the past,—an ancient past, too short to make a world in answer to creation,—did this world appear to rise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>So very long ago, for such a tiny interval of time, that not one note in Heaven’s song was missed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet in each unforgiving act or thought, in every judgment and in all belief in sin, is that one instant still called back, as if it could be made again in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You keep an ancient memory before your eyes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And he who lives in memories alone is unaware of where he is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness is the great release from time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the key to learning that the past is over.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Madness speaks no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There <i>is</i> no other teacher and no other way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For what has been undone no longer is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And who can stand upon a distant shore, and dream himself across an ocean, to a place and time that have long since gone by?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How real a hindrance can this dream be to where he really is?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For this is fact, and does not change whatever dreams he has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet can he still imagine he is elsewhere, and in another time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>In the extreme, he can delude himself that this is true, and pass from mere imagining into belief and into madness, quite convinced that where he would prefer to be, he <i>is.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is this a hindrance to the place whereon he stands?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is any echo from the past that he may hear a fact in what is there to hear where he is now?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And how much can his own illusions about time and place effect a change in where he really is?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The unforgiven is a voice that calls from out a past forevermore gone by.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And everything that points to it as real is but a wish that what is gone could be made real again and seen as here and now, in place of what is <i>really</i> now and here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is this a hindrance to the truth the past is gone, and cannot be returned to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And do you want that fearful instant kept, when Heaven seemed to disappear and God was feared and made a symbol of your hate?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forget the time of terror that has been so long ago corrected and undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Can sin withstand the Will of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Can it be up to you to see the past and put it in the present?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You can <i>not</i> go back.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And everything that points the way in the direction of the past but sets you on a mission whose accomplishment can only be unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Such is the justice your All-Loving Father has ensured must come to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And from your own unfairness to yourself has He protected you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You cannot lose your way because there is no way but His, and nowhere can you go except to Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would God allow His Son to lose his way along a road long since a memory of time gone by?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This course will teach you only what is now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A dreadful instant in a distant past, now perfectly corrected, is of no concern nor value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let the dead and gone be peacefully forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Resurrection has come to take its place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And now you are a part of resurrection, not of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No past illusions have the power to keep you in a place of death, a vault God’s Son entered an instant, to be instantly restored unto his Father’s perfect Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And how can he be kept in chains long since removed and gone forever from his mind?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Son whom God created is as free as God created him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He was reborn the instant that he chose to die instead of live.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And will you not forgive him now, because he made an error in the past that God remembers not, and is not there?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now you are shifting back and forth between the past and present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Sometimes the past seems real, as if it <i>were</i> the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Voices from the past are heard and then are doubted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are like to one who still hallucinates, but lacks conviction in what he perceives.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is the borderland between the worlds, the bridge between the past and present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Here the shadow of the past remains, but still a present light is dimly recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Once it is seen, this light can never be forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#11:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It must draw you from the past into the present, where you really are.</span></p></div> <div

time nor of eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They come from what is past and gone, and hinder not the true existence of the here and now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The real world is the second part of the hallucination time and death are real, and have existence that can be perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This terrible illusion was denied in but the time it took for God to give His Answer to illusion for all time and every circumstance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And then it was no more to be experienced as there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

single instant when the time of terror took the place of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so you die each day to live again, until you cross the gap between the past and present, which is not a gap at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Such is each life; a seeming interval from birth to death and on to life again, a repetition of an instant gone by long ago that cannot be relived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And all of time is but the mad belief that what is over is still here and now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"299#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#14:1\"><span class=\"snr

worlds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have gone on, and reached the world that lies at Heaven’s gate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"299#14:4\"><span
