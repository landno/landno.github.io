data-sentence-id=\"170#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To perceive truly is to be aware of all reality through the awareness of your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But for this no illusions can rise to meet your sight, for reality leaves no room for any error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This means that you perceive a brother only as you see him <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His past has no reality in the present, so you cannot see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your past reactions to him are also not there, and if it is to them that you react, you see but an image of him that you made and cherish instead of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In your questioning of illusions, ask yourself if it is really sane to perceive what was as now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you remember the past as you look upon your brother, you will be unable to perceive the reality that is now.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You consider it “natural” to use your past experience as the reference point from which to judge the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet this is <i>unnatural</i> because it is delusional.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you have learned to look on everyone with no reference at all to the past, either his or yours as you perceived it, you will be able to learn from what you see <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the past can cast no shadow to darken the present, <i>unless you are afraid of light.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And only if you are would you choose to bring darkness with you, and by holding it in your mind, see it as a dark cloud that shrouds your brothers and conceals their reality from your sight.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span><i>This darkness is in you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Christ as revealed to you now has no past, for He is changeless, and in His changelessness lies your release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For if He is as He was created, there is no guilt in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No cloud of guilt has risen to obscure Him, and He stands revealed in everyone you meet because you see Him through Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To be born again is to let the past go, and look without condemnation upon the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The cloud that obscures God’s Son to you <i>is</i> the past, and if you would have it past and gone, you must not see it now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you see it now in your illusions, it has not gone from you, although it is not there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Time can release as well as imprison, depending on whose interpretation of it you use.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Past, present and future are not continuous, unless you force continuity on them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can perceive them as continuous, and make them so for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But do not be deceived, and then believe that this is how it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For to believe reality is what you would have it be according to your use for it <i>is</i> delusional.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You would destroy time’s continuity by breaking it into past, present and future for your own purposes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You would anticipate the future on the basis of your past experience, and plan for it accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet by doing so you are aligning past and future, and not allowing the miracle, which could intervene between them, to free you to be born again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The miracle enables you to see your brother without his past, and so perceive him as born again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His errors are all past, and by perceiving him without them you are releasing him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And since his past is yours, you share in this release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let no dark cloud out of your past obscure him from you, for truth lies only in the present, and you will find it if you seek it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have looked for it where it is not, and therefore have not found it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Learn, then, to seek it where it is, and it will dawn on eyes that see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your past was made in anger, and if you use it to attack the present, you will not see the freedom that the present holds.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Judgment and condemnation are behind you, and unless you bring them with you, you will see that you are free of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Look lovingly upon the present, for it holds the only things that are forever true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All healing lies within it because its continuity is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It extends to all aspects of the Sonship at the same time, and thus enables them to reach each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The present is before time was, and will be when time is no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In it are all things that are eternal, and they are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Their continuity is timeless and their communication is unbroken, for they are not separated by the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Only the past can separate, and it is nowhere.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The present offers you your brothers in the light that would unite you with them, and free you from the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you, then, hold the past against them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For if you do, you are choosing to remain in the darkness that is not there, and refusing to accept the light that is offered you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the light of perfect vision is freely given as it is freely received, and can be accepted only without limit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In this one, still dimension of time that does not change, and where there is no sight of what you were, you look at Christ and call His witnesses to shine on you <i>because you called them forth.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And they will not deny the truth in you, because you looked for it in them and found it there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#8:1\"><span

touch them with the touch of Christ.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In timeless union with them is your continuity, unbroken because it is wholly shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God’s guiltless Son is only light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no darkness in him anywhere, for he is whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Call all your brothers to witness to his wholeness, as I am calling you to join with me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Each voice has a part in the song of redemption, the hymn of gladness and thanksgiving for the light to the Creator of light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The holy light that shines forth from God’s Son is the witness that his light is of his Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Shine on your brothers in remembrance of your Creator, for you will remember Him as you call forth the witnesses to His creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Those whom you heal bear witness to your healing, for in their wholeness you will see your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And as your hymns of praise and gladness rise to your Creator, He will return your thanks in His clear Answer to your call.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For it can never be that His Son called upon Him and remained unanswered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His Call to you is but your call to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in Him you are answered by His peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#10:1\"><span class=\"snr

given light to them they will return it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each one you see in light brings your light closer to your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Love always leads to love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The sick, who ask for love, are grateful for it, and in their joy they shine with holy thanks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And this they offer you who gave them joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They are your guides to joy, for having received it of you they would keep it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You have established them as guides to peace, for you have made it manifest in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And seeing it, its beauty calls you home.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"170#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#11:1\"><span class=\"snr

another.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This other world is bright with love which you have given it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#11:7\"><span

this world in quiet joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>All those you brought with you will shine on you, and you will shine on them in gratitude because they brought you here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Your light will join with theirs in power so compelling, that it will draw the others out of darkness as you

unto Christ is following the laws of love of your free will, and out of quiet recognition of the truth in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The attraction of light must draw you willingly, and willingness is signified by giving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Those who accept love of you become your willing witnesses to the love you gave them, and it is they who hold it out to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In sleep you are alone, and your awareness is narrowed to

of isolation because your eyes are closed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You do not see your brothers, and in the darkness you cannot look upon the light you

the laws of love are not suspended because you sleep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you have followed them through all your nightmares, and have been faithful in your giving, for you were not alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Even in sleep has Christ protected you, ensuring the real world for you when you awake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In your name He has given for you, and given you the gifts He gave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s Son is still as loving as his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Continuous with his Father, he has no past apart from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>So he has never ceased to be his Father’s witness and his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"170#13:8\"><span
