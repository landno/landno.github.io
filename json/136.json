Grandiosity","inlineNumber":"VIII."},"annotation":"T-9.VIII","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-9-sect-8\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Grandeur is of God, and only of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Therefore it is in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whenever you become aware of it, however dimly, you abandon the ego automatically, because in the presence of the grandeur of God the meaninglessness of the ego becomes perfectly apparent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When this occurs, even though it does not understand it, the ego believes that its “enemy” has struck, and attempts to offer gifts to induce you to return to its “protection.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Self-inflation is the only offering it can make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The grandiosity of the ego is its alternative to the grandeur of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Which will you choose?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Grandiosity is always a cover for despair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is without hope because it is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is an attempt to counteract your littleness, based on the belief that the littleness is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Without this belief grandiosity is meaningless, and you could not possibly want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The essence of grandiosity is competitiveness, because it always involves attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is a delusional attempt to outdo, but not to undo.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>We said before that the ego vacillates between suspiciousness and viciousness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It remains suspicious as long as you despair of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It shifts to viciousness when you decide not to tolerate self-abasement and seek relief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Then it offers you the illusion of attack as a “solution.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego does not understand the difference between grandeur and grandiosity, because it sees no difference between miracle impulses and ego-alien beliefs of its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I told you that the ego is aware of threat to its existence, but makes no distinctions between these two very different kinds of threat.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its profound sense of vulnerability renders it incapable of judgment except in terms of attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When the ego experiences threat, its only decision is whether to attack now or to withdraw to attack later.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you accept its offer of grandiosity it will attack immediately.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you do not, it will wait.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is immobilized in the presence of God’s grandeur, because His grandeur establishes your freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Even the faintest hint of your reality literally drives the ego from your mind, because you will give up all investment in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Grandeur is totally without illusions, and because it is real it is compellingly convincing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the conviction of reality will not remain with you unless you do not allow the ego to attack it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego will make every effort to recover and mobilize its energies against your release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It will tell you that you are insane, and argue that grandeur cannot be a real part of you because of the littleness in which it believes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet your grandeur is not delusional because you did not make it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You made grandiosity and are afraid of it because it is a form of attack, but your grandeur is of God, Who created it out of His Love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>From your grandeur you can only bless, because your grandeur is your abundance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>By blessing you hold it in your mind, protecting it from illusions and keeping yourself in the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember always that you cannot be anywhere except in the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you forget this, you <i>will</i> despair and you <i>will</i> attack.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego depends solely on your willingness to tolerate it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you are willing to look upon your grandeur you cannot despair, and therefore you cannot want the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your grandeur is God’s answer to the ego, because it is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Littleness and grandeur cannot coexist, nor is it possible for them to alternate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Littleness and grandiosity can and must alternate, since both are untrue and are therefore on the same level.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Being the level of shift, it is experienced as shifting and extremes are its essential characteristic.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth and littleness are denials of each other because grandeur is truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Truth does not vacillate; it is always true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When grandeur slips away from you, you have replaced it with something you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perhaps it is the belief in littleness; perhaps it is the belief in grandiosity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it must be insane because it is not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your grandeur will never deceive you, but your illusions always will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Illusions are deceptions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You cannot triumph, but you <i>are</i> exalted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And in your exalted state you seek others like you and rejoice with them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is easy to distinguish grandeur from grandiosity, because love is returned and pride is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Pride will not produce miracles, and will therefore deprive you of the true witnesses to your reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Truth is not obscure nor hidden, but its obviousness to you lies in the joy you bring to its witnesses, who show it to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They attest to your grandeur, but they cannot attest to pride because pride is not shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God wants you to behold what He created because it is His joy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Can your grandeur be arrogant when God Himself witnesses to it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And what can be real that has no witnesses?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What good can come of it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if no good can come of it the Holy Spirit cannot use it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What He cannot transform to the Will of God does not exist at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Grandiosity is delusional, because it is used to replace your grandeur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet what God has created cannot be replaced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God is incomplete without you because His grandeur is total, and you cannot be missing from it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are altogether irreplaceable in the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one else can fill your part in it, and while you leave your part of it empty your eternal place merely waits for your return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God, through His Voice, reminds you of it, and God Himself keeps your extensions safe within it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet you do not know them until you return to them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You cannot replace the Kingdom, and you cannot replace yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God, Who knows your value, would not have it so, and so it is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your value is in God’s Mind, and therefore not in yours alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To accept yourself as God created you cannot be arrogance, because it is the denial of arrogance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>To accept your littleness <i>is</i> arrogant, because it means that you believe your evaluation of yourself is truer than God’s.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"136#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet if truth is indivisible, your evaluation of yourself must <i>be</i> God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You did not establish your value and it needs no defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing can attack it nor prevail over it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not vary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It merely <i>is.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ask the Holy Spirit what it is and He will tell you, but do not be afraid of His answer, because it comes from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is an exalted answer because of its Source, but the Source is true and so is Its answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Listen and do not question what you hear, for God does not deceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"136#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>He would have you replace the ego’s belief in littleness with His Own exalted Answer to what you are, so that you can cease to question it and know it for what it is.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Grandeur is of God, and only
