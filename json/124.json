class=\"snr\">2</span>We begin the journey back by setting out together, and gather in our brothers as we continue together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Every gain in our strength is offered for all, so they too can lay aside their weakness and add their strength to us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God’s welcome waits for us all, and He will welcome us as I am welcoming you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Forget not the Kingdom of God for anything the world has to

nothing to the power and the glory of God and His holy Sons, but it can blind the Sons to the Father if they behold it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot behold the world and know God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only one is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I am come to tell you that the choice of which is true is not yours to make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If it were, you would have destroyed yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet God did not will the destruction of His creations, having created them for eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His Will has saved you, not from yourself but from your illusion of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He has saved you <i>for</i> yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"124#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us glorify Him Whom the world denies, for over His Kingdom the world has no power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No one created by God can find joy in anything except the eternal; not because he is deprived of anything else, but because nothing else is worthy of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What God and His Sons create is eternal, and in this and this only is Their joy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"124#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Listen to the story of the prodigal son, and learn what God’s treasure is and yours: This son of a loving father left his home and thought he had squandered everything for nothing of any value, although he had not understood its worthlessness at the time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He was ashamed to return to his father, because he thought he had hurt him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet when he came home the father welcomed him with joy, because the son himself <i>was</i> his father’s treasure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He wanted nothing else.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"124#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God wants only His Son because His Son is His only treasure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You want your creations as He wants His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your creations are your gift to the Holy Trinity, created in gratitude for your creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They do not leave you any more than you left your Creator, but they extend your creation as God extended Himself to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can the creations of God Himself take joy in what is not real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And what is real except the creations of God and those that are created like His?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your creations love you as you love your Father for the gift of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There is no other gift that is eternal, and therefore there is no other gift that is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>How, then, can you accept anything else or give anything else, and expect joy in return?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And what else but joy would you want?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You made neither yourself nor your function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>You made only the decision to be unworthy of both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Yet you cannot make yourself unworthy because you are the treasure of God, and what He values is valuable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#5:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>There can be no question of its worth, because its value lies in God’s sharing Himself with it and establishing its value forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"124#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your function is to add to God’s treasure by creating yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His Will <i>to</i> you is His Will <i>for</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He would not withhold creation from you because His joy is in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot find joy except as God does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His joy lay in creating you, and He extends His Fatherhood to you so that you can extend yourself as He did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You do not understand this because you do not understand Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one who does not accept his function can understand what it is, and no one can accept his function unless he knows what <i>he</i> is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Creation is the Will of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>His Will created you to create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Your will was not created separate from His, and so you must will as He wills.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"124#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>An “unwilling will” does not mean anything, being a contradiction in terms that actually means nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you think you are unwilling to will with God, you are not thinking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s Will <i>is</i> Thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It cannot be contradicted <i>by</i> thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God does not contradict Himself, and His Sons, who are like Him, cannot contradict themselves or Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet their thought is so powerful that they can even imprison the mind of God’s Son, if they so choose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This choice does make the Son’s function unknown to him, but never to his Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And because it is not unknown to his Creator, it is forever knowable to him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"124#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no question but one you should ever ask of yourself;—“Do I want to know my Father’s Will for me?”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He will not hide it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has revealed it to me because I asked it of Him, and learned of what He had already given.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Our function is to work together, because apart from each other we cannot function at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The whole power of God’s Son lies in all of us, but not in any of us alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God would not have us be alone because <i>He</i> does not will to be alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is why He created His Son, and gave him the power to create with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Our creations are as holy as we are, and we are the Sons of God Himself, as holy as He is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Through our creations we extend our love, and thus increase the joy of the Holy Trinity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You do not understand this, because you who are God’s Own treasure do not regard yourself as valuable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Given this belief, you cannot understand anything.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"124#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I share with God the knowledge of the value He puts upon you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>My devotion to you is of Him, being born of my knowledge of myself and Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We cannot be separated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whom God has joined cannot be separated, and God has joined all His Sons with Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can you be separated from your life and your being?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The journey to God is merely the reawakening of the knowledge of where you are always, and what you are forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is a journey without distance to a goal that has never changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Truth can only be experienced.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It cannot be described and it cannot be explained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I can make you aware of the conditions of truth, but the experience is of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Together we can meet its conditions, but truth will dawn upon you of itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"124#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What God has willed for you <i>is</i> yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He has given His Will to His treasure, whose treasure it is.</span> <span

beloved of God are wholly blessed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"124#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Learn this of me, and free the holy will of all those who are as blessed as you
