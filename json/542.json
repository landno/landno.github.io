data-sentence-id=\"542#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today’s idea remains the central thought on which salvation rests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For healing is the opposite of all the world’s ideas which dwell on sickness and on separate states.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Sickness is a retreat from others, and a shutting off of joining.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It becomes a door that closes on a separate self, and keeps it isolated and alone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness is isolation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it seems to keep one self apart from all the rest, to suffer what the others do not feel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It gives the body final power to make the separation real, and keep the mind in solitary prison, split apart and held in pieces by a solid wall of sickened flesh, which it can not surmount.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world obeys the laws that sickness serves, but healing operates apart from them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is impossible that anyone be healed alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In sickness must he be apart and separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But healing is his own decision to be one again, and to accept his Self with all Its parts intact and unassailed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In sickness does his Self appear to be dismembered, and without the unity that gives It life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But healing is accomplished as he sees the body has no power to attack the universal Oneness of God’s Son.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness would prove that lies must be the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But healing demonstrates that truth is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The separation sickness would impose has never really happened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To be healed is merely to accept what always was the simple truth, and always will remain exactly as it has forever been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet eyes accustomed to illusions must be shown that what they look upon is false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>So healing, never needed by the truth, must demonstrate that sickness is not real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing might thus be called a counter-dream, which cancels out the dream of sickness in the name of truth, but not in truth itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Just as forgiveness overlooks all sins that never were accomplished, healing but removes illusions that have not occurred.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Just as the real world will arise to take the place of what has never been at all, healing but offers restitution for imagined states and false ideas which dreams embroider into pictures of the truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet think not healing is unworthy of your function here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For anti-Christ becomes more powerful than Christ to those who dream the world is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body seems to be more solid and more stable than the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And love becomes a dream, while fear remains the one reality that can be seen and justified and fully understood.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Just as forgiveness shines away all sin and the real world will occupy the place of what you made, so healing must replace the fantasies of sickness which you hold before the simple truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When sickness has been seen to disappear in spite of all the laws that hold it cannot but be real, then questions have been answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And the laws can be no longer cherished nor obeyed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing is freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For it demonstrates that dreams will not prevail against the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Healing is shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And by this attribute it proves that laws unlike the ones which hold that sickness is inevitable are more potent than their sickly opposites.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Healing is strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For by its gentle hand is weakness overcome, and minds that were walled off within a body free to join with other minds, to be forever strong.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing, forgiveness, and the glad exchange of all the world of sorrow for a world where sadness cannot enter, are the means by which the Holy Spirit urges you to follow Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His gentle lessons teach how easily salvation can be yours; how little practice you need undertake to let His laws replace the ones you made to hold yourself a prisoner to death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His life becomes your own, as you extend the little help He asks in freeing you from everything that ever caused you pain.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And as you let yourself be healed, you see all those around you, or who cross your mind, or whom you touch or those who seem to have no contact with you, healed along with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps you will not recognize them all, nor realize how great your offering to all the world, when you let healing come to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But you are never healed alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And legions upon legions will receive the gift that you receive when you are healed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Those who are healed become the instruments of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor does time elapse between the instant they are healed, and all the grace of healing it is given them to give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What is opposed to God does not exist, and who accepts it not within his mind becomes a haven where the weary can remain to rest.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For here is truth bestowed, and here are all illusions brought to truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you not offer shelter to God’s Will?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You but invite your Self to be at home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And can this invitation be refused?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Ask the inevitable to occur, and you will never fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The other choice is but to ask what cannot be to be, and this can not succeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Today we ask that only truth will occupy our minds; that thoughts of healing will this day go forth from what is healed to what must yet be healed, aware that they will both occur as one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will remember, as the hour strikes, our function is to let our minds be healed, that we may carry healing to the world, exchanging curse for blessing, pain for joy, and separation for the peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is not a minute of the hour worth the giving to receive a gift like this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is not a little time a small expense to offer for the gift of everything?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet must we be prepared for such a gift.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so we will begin the day with this, and give ten minutes to these thoughts with which we will conclude today at night as well:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"542#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When I am healed I am not healed alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And I would share my healing with the world, that sickness may be banished from the mind of God’s one Son, Who is my only Self.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"542#15\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">15.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#15:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let healing be through you this very day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#15:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And as you rest in quiet, be prepared to give as you receive, to hold but what you give, and to receive the Word of God to take the place of all the foolish thoughts that ever were imagined.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Now we come together to make well all that was sick, and offer blessing where there was attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#15:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor will we let this function be forgot as every hour of the day slips by, remembering our purpose with this thought:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"542#15:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When I am healed I am not healed alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#15:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And I would bless my brothers, for I would be healed with them, as they are healed with me.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Today’s idea remains the central thought on which salvation rests.
