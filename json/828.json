data-sentence-id=\"828#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Although in truth the term sacrifice is altogether meaningless, it does have meaning in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Like all things in the world, its meaning is temporary and will ultimately fade into the nothingness from which it came when there is no more use for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Now its real meaning is a lesson.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Like all lessons it is an illusion, for in reality there is nothing to learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet this illusion must be replaced by a corrective device; another illusion that replaces the first, so both can finally disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The first illusion, which must be displaced before another thought system can take hold, is that it is a sacrifice to give up the things of this world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What could this be but an illusion, since this world itself is nothing more than that?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"828#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It takes great learning both to realize and to accept the fact that the world has nothing to give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What can the sacrifice of nothing mean?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It cannot mean that you have less because of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no sacrifice in the world’s terms that does not involve the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Think a while about what the world calls sacrifice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Power, fame, money, physical pleasure; who is the “hero” to whom all these things belong?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Could they mean anything except to a body?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet a body cannot evaluate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>By seeking after such things the mind associates itself with the body, obscuring its Identity and losing sight of what it really is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"828#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Once this confusion has occurred, it becomes impossible for the mind to understand that all the “pleasures” of the world are nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But what a sacrifice,—and it is sacrifice indeed! — all this entails.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Now has the mind condemned itself to seek without finding; to be forever dissatisfied and discontented; to know not what it really wants to find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who can escape this self-condemnation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only through God’s Word could this be possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For self-condemnation is a decision about identity, and no one doubts what he believes he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He can doubt all things, but never this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"828#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God’s teachers can have no regret on giving up the pleasures of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is it a sacrifice to give up pain?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Does an adult resent the giving up of children’s toys?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Does one whose vision has already glimpsed the face of Christ look back with longing on a slaughter house?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one who has escaped the world and all its ills looks back on it with condemnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet he must rejoice that he is free of all the sacrifice its values would demand of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To them he sacrifices all his peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To them he sacrifices all his freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And to possess them must he sacrifice his hope of Heaven and remembrance of his Father’s Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Who in his sane mind chooses nothing as a substitute for everything?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"828#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is the real meaning of sacrifice?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the cost of believing in illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the price that must be paid for the denial of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no pleasure of the world that does not demand this, for otherwise the pleasure would be seen as pain, and no one asks for pain if he recognizes it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the idea of sacrifice that makes him blind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He does not see what he is asking for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so he seeks it in a thousand ways and in a thousand places, each time believing it is there, and each time disappointed in the end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>“Seek but do not find” remains this world’s stern decree, and no one who pursues the world’s goals can do otherwise.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"828#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may believe this course requires sacrifice of all you really hold dear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In one sense this is true, for you hold dear the things that crucify God’s Son, and it is the course’s aim to set him free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But do not be mistaken about what sacrifice means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It always means the giving up of what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what, O teacher of God, is it that you want?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have been called by God, and you have answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Would you now sacrifice that Call?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Few have heard it as yet, and they can but turn to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>There is no other hope in all the world that they can trust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>There is no other voice in all the world that echoes God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>If you would sacrifice the truth, they stay in hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And if they stay, you will remain with them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"828#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Do not forget that sacrifice is total.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There are no half sacrifices.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot give up Heaven partially.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot be a little bit in hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Word of God has no exceptions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is this that makes it holy and beyond the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is its holiness that points to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is its holiness that makes you safe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is denied if you attack any brother for anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For it is here the split with God occurs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>A split that is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>A split that cannot happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Yet a split in which you surely will believe, because you have set up a situation that is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>And in this situation the impossible can seem to happen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#7:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>It seems to happen at the “sacrifice” of truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"828#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Teacher of God, do not forget the meaning of sacrifice, and remember what each decision you make must mean in terms of cost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Decide for God, and everything is given you at no cost at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Decide against Him, and you choose nothing, at the expense of the awareness of everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What would you teach?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember only what you would learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For it is here that your concern should be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Atonement is for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your learning claims it and your learning gives it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The world contains it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>But learn this course and it is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>God holds out His Word to you, for He has need of teachers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"828#8:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>What other way is there to save His Son?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Although in truth the term sacrifice is altogether
