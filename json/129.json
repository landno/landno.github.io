made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It could not possibly have occurred unless the mind were already profoundly split, making it possible for it to be afraid of what it really is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Reality cannot “threaten” anything except illusions, since reality can only uphold truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The very fact that the Will of God, which is what you are, is perceived as fearful, demonstrates that you <i>are</i> afraid of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not, then, the Will of God of which you are afraid, but yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your will is not the ego’s, and that is why the ego is against you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What seems to be the fear of God is really the fear of your own reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is impossible to learn anything consistently in a state of panic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If the purpose of this course is to help you remember what you are, and if you believe that what you are is fearful, then it must follow that you will not learn this course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet the reason for the course is that you do not know what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you do not know what your reality is, why would you be so sure that it is fearful?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The association of truth and fear, which would be highly artificial at most, is particularly inappropriate in the minds of those who do not know what truth is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All this could mean is that you are arbitrarily associating something beyond your awareness with something you do not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is evident, then, that you are judging something of which you are totally unaware.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have set up this strange situation so that it is impossible to escape from it without a Guide Who <i>does</i> know what your reality is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The purpose of this Guide is merely to remind you of what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He is not attempting to force an alien will upon you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is merely making every possible effort, within the limits you impose on Him, to re-establish your own will in your awareness.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have imprisoned your will beyond your own awareness, where it remains, but cannot help you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When I said that the Holy Spirit’s function is to sort out the true from the false in your mind, I meant that He has the power to look into what you have hidden and recognize the Will of God there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His recognition of this Will can make it real to you because He is in your mind, and therefore He is your reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If, then, His perception of your mind brings its reality to you, He <i>is</i> helping you to remember what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The only source of fear in this process is what you think you will lose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it is only what the Holy Spirit sees that you can possibly have.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have emphasized many times that the Holy Spirit will never call upon you to sacrifice anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But if you ask the sacrifice of reality of yourself, the Holy Spirit must remind you that this is not God’s Will because it is not yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no difference between your will and God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you did not have a split mind, you would recognize that willing is salvation because it is communication.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible to communicate in alien tongues.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You and your Creator can communicate through creation, because that, and only that is Your joint Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A divided mind cannot communicate, because it speaks for different things to the same mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This loses the ability to communicate simply because confused communication does not mean anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>A message cannot be communicated unless it makes sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How sensible can your messages be, when you ask for what you do not want?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet as long as you are afraid of your will, that is precisely what you are asking for.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may insist that the Holy Spirit does not answer you, but it might be wiser to consider the kind of questioner you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not ask only for what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is because you are afraid you might receive it, and you would.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is why you persist in asking the teacher who could not possibly give you what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Of him you can never learn what it is, and this gives you the illusion of safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet you cannot be safe <i>from</i> truth, but only <i>in</i> truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Reality is the only safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your will is your salvation because it is the same as God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The separation is nothing more than the belief that it is different.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No right mind can believe that its will is stronger than God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If, then, a mind believes that its will is different from His, it can only decide either that there is no God or that God’s Will is fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The former accounts for the atheist and the latter for the martyr, who believes that God demands sacrifices.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Either of these insane decisions will induce panic, because the atheist believes he is alone, and the martyr believes that God is crucifying him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet no one really wants either abandonment or retaliation, even though many may seek both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can you ask the Holy Spirit for “gifts” such as these, and actually expect to receive them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He cannot give you something you do not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>When you ask the Universal Giver for what you do not want, you are asking for what cannot be given because it was never created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It was never created, because it was never your will for <i>you.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Ultimately everyone must remember the Will of God, because ultimately everyone must recognize himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This recognition is the recognition that his will and God’s are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In the presence of truth, there are no unbelievers and no sacrifices.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the security of reality, fear is totally meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To deny what is can only <i>seem</i> to be fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Fear cannot be real without a cause, and God is the only Cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God is Love and you do want Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This <i>is</i> your will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Ask for this and you will be answered, because you will be asking only for what belongs to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you ask the Holy Spirit for what would hurt you He cannot answer because nothing can hurt you, and so you are asking for nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Any wish that stems from the ego is a wish for nothing, and to ask for it is not a request.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is merely a denial in the form of a request.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy Spirit is not concerned with form, being aware only of meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The ego cannot ask the Holy Spirit for anything, because there is complete communication failure between them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet <i>you</i> can ask for everything of the Holy Spirit, because your requests to Him are real, being of your right mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Would the Holy Spirit deny the Will of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And could He fail to recognize it in His Son?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not recognize the enormous waste of energy you expend in denying truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What would you say of someone who persists in attempting the impossible, believing that to achieve it is to succeed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The belief that you must have the impossible in order to be happy is totally at variance with the principle of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God could not will that happiness depended on what you could never have.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The fact that God is Love does not require belief, but it does require acceptance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is indeed possible for you to deny facts, although it is impossible for you to change them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you hold your hands over your eyes, you will not see because you are interfering with the laws of seeing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you deny love, you will not know it because your cooperation is the law of its being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You cannot change laws you did not make, and the laws of happiness were created for you, not by you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Any attempt to deny what <i>is</i> must be fearful, and if the attempt is strong it will induce panic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Willing against reality, though impossible, can be made into a very persistent goal even though you do not want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But consider the result of this strange decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are devoting your mind to what you do not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How real can this devotion be?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>If you do not want it, it was never created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If it were never created, it is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can you really devote yourself to nothing?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God in His devotion to you created you devoted to everything, and gave you what you are devoted <i>to</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Otherwise you would not have been created perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Reality is everything, and you have everything because you are real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot make the unreal because the absence of reality is fearful, and fear cannot be created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>As long as you believe that fear is possible, you will not create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Opposing orders of reality make reality meaningless, and reality <i>is</i> meaning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"129#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Remember, then, that God’s Will is already possible, and nothing else will ever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the simple acceptance of reality, because only that is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot distort reality and know what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if you do distort reality you will experience anxiety, depression and ultimately panic, because you are trying to make yourself unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When you feel these things, do not try to look beyond yourself for truth, for truth can only be within you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"129#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Say, therefore:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"129#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Christ is in me, and where He is God must be, for Christ is part of Him.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Fear of the Will of God is one of the strangest beliefs the human mind has ever made.
