God","inlineNumber":"VI."},"annotation":"T-4.VI","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-4-sect-6\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"085#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego does not recognize the real source of “threat,” and if you associate yourself with the ego, you do not understand the situation as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only your allegiance to it gives the ego any power over you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have spoken of the ego as if it were a separate thing, acting on its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This was necessary to persuade you that you cannot dismiss it lightly, and must realize how much of your thinking is ego-directed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We cannot safely let it go at that, however, or you will regard yourself as necessarily conflicted as long as you are here, or as long as you believe that you are here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego is nothing more than a part of your belief about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Your other life has continued without interruption, and has been and always will be totally unaffected by your attempts to dissociate it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"085#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In learning to escape from illusions, your debt to your brother is something you must never forget.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the same debt that you owe to me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whenever you act egotistically towards another, you are throwing away the graciousness of your indebtedness and the holy perception it would produce.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The term “holy” can be used here because, as you learn how much you are indebted to the whole Sonship, which includes me, you come as close to knowledge as perception can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The gap is then so small that knowledge can easily flow across it and obliterate it forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"085#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have very little trust in me as yet, but it will increase as you turn more and more often to me instead of to your ego for guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The results will convince you increasingly that this choice is the only sane one you can make.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No one who learns from experience that one choice brings peace and joy while another brings chaos and disaster needs additional convincing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Learning through rewards is more effective than learning through pain, because pain is an ego illusion, and can never induce more than a temporary effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The rewards of God, however, are immediately recognized as eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Since this recognition is made by you and not the ego, the recognition itself establishes that you and your ego cannot be identical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You may believe that you have already accepted this difference, but you are by no means convinced as yet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The fact that you believe you must escape from the ego shows this; but you cannot escape from the ego by humbling it or controlling it or punishing it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"085#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego and the spirit do not know each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The separated mind cannot maintain the separation except by dissociating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Having done this, it denies all truly natural impulses, not because the ego is a separate thing, but because you want to believe that <i>you</i> are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego is a device for maintaining this belief, but it is still only your decision to use the device that enables it to endure.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"085#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can you teach someone the value of something he has deliberately thrown away?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He must have thrown it away because he did not value it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can only show him how miserable he is without it, and slowly bring it nearer so he can learn how his misery lessens as he approaches it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This teaches him to associate his misery with its absence, and the opposite of misery with its presence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It gradually becomes desirable as he changes his mind about its worth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I am teaching you to associate misery with the ego and joy with the spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have taught yourself the opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You are still free to choose, but can you really want the rewards of the ego in the presence of the rewards of God?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"085#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>My trust in you is greater than yours in me at the moment, but it will not always be that way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your mission is very simple.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are asked to live so as to demonstrate that you are not an ego, and I do not choose God’s channels wrongly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Holy One shares my trust, and accepts my Atonement decisions because my will is never out of accord with His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I have said before that I am in charge of the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is only because I completed my part in it as a man, and can now complete it through others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>My chosen channels cannot fail, because I will lend them my strength as long as theirs is wanting.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"085#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I will go with you to the Holy One, and through my perception He can bridge the little gap.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your gratitude to your brother is the only gift I want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I will bring it to God for you, knowing that to know your brother <i>is</i> to know God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you are grateful to your brother, you are grateful to God for what He created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Through your gratitude you come to know your brother, and one moment of real recognition makes everyone your brother because each of them is of your Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Love does not conquer all things, but it does set all things right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Because you are the Kingdom of God I can lead you back to your own creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You do not recognize them now, but what has been dissociated is still there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"085#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As you come closer to a brother you approach me, and as you withdraw from him I become distant to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Salvation is a collaborative venture.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It cannot be undertaken successfully by those who disengage themselves from the Sonship, because they are disengaging themselves from me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God will come to you only as you will give Him to your brothers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Learn first of them and you will be ready to hear God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"085#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is because the function of love is one.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The ego does not recognize the real source of “threat,” and if you associate yourself with the ego, you do not understand the
