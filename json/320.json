and yet it is not here.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It has not judged itself, nor made itself to be what it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not seek to make of pain a joy and look for lasting pleasure in the dust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It does not tell you what its purpose is and cannot understand what it is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It does not victimize, because it has no will, no preferences and no doubts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It does not wonder what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so it has no need to be competitive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It can be victimized, but cannot feel itself as victim.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It accepts no role, but does what it is told, without attack.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"320#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is indeed a senseless point of view to hold responsible for sight a thing that cannot see, and blame it for the sounds you do not like, although it cannot hear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It suffers not the punishment you give because it has no feeling.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It behaves in ways you want, but never makes the choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not born and does not die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It can but follow aimlessly the path on which it has been set.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if that path is changed, it walks as easily another way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It takes no sides and judges not the road it travels.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It perceives no gap, because it does not hate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It can be used for hate, but it cannot be hateful made thereby.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"320#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The thing you hate and fear and loathe and want, the body does not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You send it forth to seek for separation and be separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And then you hate it, not for what it is, but for the uses you have made of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You shrink from what it sees and what it hears, and hate its frailty and littleness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you despise its acts, but not your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It sees and acts for <i>you.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It hears your voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And it is frail and little by your wish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It seems to punish you, and thus deserve your hatred for the limitations that it brings to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet you have made of it a symbol for the limitations that you want your mind to have and see and keep.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"320#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body represents the gap between the little bit of mind you call your own and all the rest of what is really yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You hate it, yet you think it is your self, and that, without it, would your self be lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the secret vow that you have made with every brother who would walk apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the secret oath you take again, whenever you perceive yourself attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one can suffer if he does not see himself attacked, and losing by attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Unstated and unheard in consciousness is every pledge to sickness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet it is a promise to another to be hurt by him, and to attack him in return.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"320#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness is anger taken out upon the body, so that it will suffer pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the obvious effect of what was made in secret, in agreement with another’s secret wish to be apart from you, as you would be apart from him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Unless you both agree that is your wish, it can have no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Whoever says, “There is no gap between my mind and yours” has kept God’s promise, not his tiny oath to be forever faithful unto death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And by his healing is his brother healed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"320#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let this be your agreement with each one; that you be one with him and not apart.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And he will keep the promise that you make with him, because it is the one that he has made to God, as God has made to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God keeps His promises; His Son keeps his.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In his creation did his Father say, “You are beloved of Me and I of you forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Be you perfect as Myself, for you can never be apart from Me.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His Son remembers not that he replied “I will,” though in that promise he was born.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet God reminds him of it every time he does not share a promise to be sick, but lets his mind be healed and unified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>His secret vows are powerless before the Will of God, Whose promises he shares.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"320#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And what he substitutes is not his will, who has made promise of himself to God.</span></p></div>
