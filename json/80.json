data-sentence-id=\"080#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A good teacher clarifies his own ideas and strengthens them by teaching them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Teacher and pupil are alike in the learning process.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They are in the same order of learning, and unless they share their lessons conviction will be lacking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A good teacher must believe in the ideas he teaches, but he must meet another condition; he must believe in the students to whom he offers the ideas.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Many stand guard over their ideas because they want to protect their thought systems as they are, and learning means change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Change is always fearful to the separated, because they cannot conceive of it as a move towards healing the separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They always perceive it as a move toward further separation, because the separation was their first experience of change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You believe that if you allow no change to enter into your ego you will find peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This profound confusion is possible only if you maintain that the same thought system can stand on two foundations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing can reach spirit from the ego, and nothing can reach the ego from spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Spirit can neither strengthen the ego nor reduce the conflict within it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The ego <i>is</i> a contradiction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your self and God’s Self <i>are</i> in opposition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>They are opposed in source, in direction and in outcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>They are fundamentally irreconcilable, because spirit cannot perceive and the ego cannot know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>They are therefore not in communication and can never be in communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Nevertheless, the ego can learn, even though its maker can be misguided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#2:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>He cannot, however, make the totally lifeless out of the life-given.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Spirit need not be taught, but the ego must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Learning is ultimately perceived as frightening because it leads to the relinquishment, not the destruction, of the ego to the light of spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the change the ego must fear, because it does not share my charity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>My lesson was like yours, and because I learned it I can teach it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I will never attack your ego, but I am trying to teach you how its thought system arose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When I remind you of your true creation, your ego cannot but respond with fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Teaching and learning are your greatest strengths now, because they enable you to change your mind and help others to change theirs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Refusing to change your mind will not prove that the separation has not occurred.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The dreamer who doubts the reality of his dream while he is still dreaming is not really healing his split mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You dream of a separated ego and believe in a world that rests upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is very real to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot undo it by not changing your mind about it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you are willing to renounce the role of guardian of your thought system and open it to me, I will correct it very gently and lead you back to God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every good teacher hopes to give his students so much of his own learning that they will one day no longer need him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is the one true goal of the teacher.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is impossible to convince the ego of this, because it goes against all of its own laws.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But remember that laws are set up to protect the continuity of the system in which the lawmaker believes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is natural for the ego to try to protect itself once you have made it, but it is not natural for you to want to obey its laws unless <i>you</i> believe them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego cannot make this choice because of the nature of its origin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You can, because of the nature of yours.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Egos can clash in any situation, but spirit cannot clash at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you perceive a teacher as merely “a larger ego” you will be afraid, because to enlarge an ego would be to increase anxiety about separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I will teach with you and live with you if you will think with me, but my goal will always be to absolve you finally from the need for a teacher.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is the opposite of the ego-oriented teacher’s goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is concerned with the effect of his ego on other egos, and therefore interprets their interaction as a means of ego preservation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I would not be able to devote myself to teaching if I believed this, and you will not be a devoted teacher as long as you believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I am constantly being perceived as a teacher either to be exalted or rejected, but I do not accept either perception for myself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your worth is not established by teaching or learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your worth is established by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As long as you dispute this everything you do will be fearful, particularly any situation that lends itself to the belief in superiority and inferiority.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Teachers must be patient and repeat their lessons until they are learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I am willing to do this, because I have no right to set your learning limits for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Again,—nothing you do or think or wish or make is necessary to establish your worth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This point is not debatable except in delusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your ego is never at stake because God did not create it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your spirit is never at stake because He did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Any confusion on this point is delusional, and no form of devotion is possible as long as this delusion lasts.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego tries to exploit all situations into forms of praise for itself in order to overcome its doubts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It will remain doubtful as long as you believe in its existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You who made it cannot trust it, because in your right mind you realize it is not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The only sane solution is not to try to change reality, which is indeed a fearful attempt, but to accept it as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are part of reality, which stands unchanged beyond the reach of your ego but within easy reach of spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you are afraid, be still and know that God is real, and you are His beloved Son in whom He is well pleased.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not let your ego dispute this, because the ego cannot know what is as far beyond its reach as you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God is not the author of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have chosen to create unlike Him, and have therefore made fear for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are not at peace because you are not fulfilling your function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God gave you a very lofty function that you are not meeting.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your ego has chosen to be afraid instead of meeting it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When you awaken you will not be able to understand this, because it is literally incredible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span><i>Do not believe the incredible now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Any attempt to increase its believableness is merely to postpone the inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The word “inevitable” is fearful to the ego, but joyous to the spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>God is inevitable, and you cannot avoid Him any more than He can avoid you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is afraid of the spirit’s joy, because once you have experienced it you will withdraw all protection from the ego, and become totally without investment in fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your investment is great now because fear is a witness to the separation, and your ego rejoices when you witness to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Leave it behind!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do not listen to it and do not preserve it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Listen only to God, Who is as incapable of deception as is the spirit He created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Release yourself and release others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not present a false and unworthy picture of yourself to others, and do not accept such a picture of them yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego has built a shabby and unsheltering home for you, because it cannot build otherwise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not try to make this impoverished house stand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its weakness is your strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only God could make a home that is worthy of His creations, who have chosen to leave it empty by their own dispossession.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet His home will stand forever, and is ready for you when you choose to enter it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Of this you can be wholly certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God is as incapable of creating the perishable as the ego is of making the eternal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"080#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Of your ego you can do nothing to save yourself or others, but of your spirit you can do everything for the salvation of both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Humility is a lesson for the ego, not for the spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Spirit is beyond humility, because it recognizes its radiance and gladly sheds its light everywhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The meek shall inherit the earth because their egos are humble, and this gives them truer perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Kingdom of Heaven is the spirit’s right, whose beauty and dignity are far beyond doubt, beyond perception, and stand forever as the mark of the Love of God for His creations, who are wholly worthy of Him and only of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nothing else is sufficiently worthy to be a gift for a creation of God Himself.</span></p></div> <div

but never for your spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>A father can safely leave a child with an elder brother who has shown himself responsible, but this involves no confusion about the child’s origin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The brother can protect the child’s body and his ego, but he does not confuse himself with the father because he does this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I can be entrusted with your body and your ego only because this enables you not to be concerned with them, and lets me teach you their unimportance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I could not understand their importance to you if I had not once been tempted to believe in them myself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Let us undertake to learn this lesson together so we can be free of them together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I need devoted teachers who share my aim of healing the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"080#13:8\"><span
