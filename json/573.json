data-sentence-id=\"573#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There are not different kinds of life, for life is like the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not have degrees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the one condition in which all that God created share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Like all His Thoughts, it has no opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no death because what God created shares His life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no death because an opposite to God does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no death because the Father and the Son are one.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this world, there appears to be a state that is life’s opposite.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You call it death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet we have learned that the idea of death takes many forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the one idea which underlies all feelings that are not supremely happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the alarm to which you give response of any kind that is not perfect joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All sorrow, loss, anxiety and suffering and pain, even a little sigh of weariness, a slight discomfort or the merest frown, acknowledge death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And thus deny you live.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You think that death is of the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it is but an idea, irrelevant to what is seen as physical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A thought is in the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It can be then applied as mind directs it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But its origin is where it must be changed, if change occurs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Ideas leave not their source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The emphasis this course has placed on that idea is due to its centrality in our attempts to change your mind about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is the reason you can heal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is the cause of healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is why you cannot die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Its truth established you as one with God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Death is the thought that you are separate from your Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the belief conditions change, emotions alternate because of causes you cannot control, you did not make, and you can never change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the fixed belief ideas can leave their source, and take on qualities the source does not contain, becoming different from their own origin, apart from it in kind as well as distance, time and form.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Death cannot come from life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Ideas remain united to their source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They can extend all that their source contains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In that, they can go far beyond themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But they can not give birth to what was never given them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As they are made, so will their making be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As they were born, so will they then give birth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And where they come from, there will they return.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The mind can think it sleeps, but that is all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It cannot change what is its waking state.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It cannot make a body, nor abide within a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is alien to the mind does not exist, because it has no source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For mind creates all things that are, and cannot give them attributes it lacks, nor change its own eternal, mindful state.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It cannot make the physical.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What seems to die is but the sign of mind asleep.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The opposite of life can only be another form of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As such, it can be reconciled with what created it, because it is not opposite in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its form may change; it may appear to be what it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet mind is mind, awake or sleeping.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not its opposite in anything created, nor in what it seems to make when it believes it sleeps.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God creates only mind awake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He does not sleep, and His creations cannot share what He gives not, nor make conditions which He does not share with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The thought of death is not the opposite to thoughts of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Forever unopposed by opposites of any kind, the Thoughts of God remain forever changeless, with the power to extend forever changelessly, but yet within themselves, for they are everywhere.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What seems to be the opposite of life is merely sleeping.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When the mind elects to be what it is not, and to assume an alien power which it does not have, a foreign state it cannot enter, or a false condition not within its Source, it merely seems to go to sleep a while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It dreams of time; an interval in which what seems to happen never has occurred, the changes wrought are substanceless, and all events are nowhere.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When the mind awakes, it but continues as it always was.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us today be children of the truth, and not deny our holy heritage.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Our life is not as we imagine it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who changes life because he shuts his eyes, or makes himself what he is not because he sleeps, and sees in dreams an opposite to what he is?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We will not ask for death in any form today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Nor will we let imagined opposites to life abide even an instant where the Thought of life eternal has been set by God Himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>His holy home we strive to keep today as He established it, and wills it be forever and forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is Lord of what we think today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And in His Thoughts, which have no opposite, we understand there is one life, and that we share with Him, with all creation, with their thoughts as well, whom He created in a unity of life that cannot separate in death and leave the Source of life from where it came.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"573#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We share one life because we have one Source, a Source from which perfection comes to us, remaining always in the holy minds which He created perfect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As we were, so are we now and will forever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A sleeping mind must waken, as it sees its own perfection mirroring the Lord of life so perfectly it fades into what is reflected there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And now it is no more a mere reflection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It becomes the thing reflected, and the light which makes reflection possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No vision now is needed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"573#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For the wakened mind is one that knows its Source, its Self, its Holiness.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"There
