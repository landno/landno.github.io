class=\"snr\">2</span>His is the realm of knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet He has created the Holy Spirit as the Mediator between perception and knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Without this link with God, perception would have replaced knowledge forever in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>With this link with God, perception will become so changed and purified that it will lead to knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is its function as the Holy Spirit sees it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Therefore, that is its function in truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"445#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In God you cannot see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perception has no function in God, and does not exist.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet in salvation, which is the undoing of what never was, perception has a mighty purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Made by the Son of God for an unholy purpose, it must become the means for the restoration of his holiness to his awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perception has no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet does the Holy Spirit give it a meaning very close to God‚Äôs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Healed perception becomes the means by which the Son of God forgives his brother, and thus forgives himself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"445#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot see apart from God because you cannot be apart from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Whatever you do you do in Him, because whatever you think, you think with His Mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If vision is real, and it is real to the extent to which it shares the Holy Spirit‚Äôs purpose, then you cannot see apart from God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"445#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Three five-minute practice periods are required today, one as early and one as late as possible in the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The third may be undertaken at the most convenient and suitable time that circumstances and readiness permit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>At the beginning of these practice periods, repeat the idea for today to yourself with eyes open.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then glance around you for a short time, applying the idea specifically to what you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Four or five subjects for this phase of the practice period are sufficient.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You might say, for example:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God is my Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I cannot see this desk apart from Him.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>God is my Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I cannot see that picture apart from Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"445#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Although this part of the exercise period should be relatively short, be sure that you select the subjects for this phase of practice indiscriminately, without self-directed inclusion or exclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the second and longer phase, close your eyes, repeat today‚Äôs idea again, and then let whatever relevant thoughts occur to you add to the idea in your own personal way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thoughts such as:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"445#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I see through the eyes of forgiveness.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I see the world as blessed.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The world can show me myself.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I see my own thoughts, which are like God‚Äôs.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"445#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Any thought related more or less directly to today‚Äôs idea is suitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The thoughts need not bear any obvious relationship to the idea, but they should not be in opposition to it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"445#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you find your mind wandering; if you begin to be aware of thoughts which are clearly out of accord with today‚Äôs idea, or if you seem to be unable to think of anything, open your eyes, repeat the first phase of the exercise period, and then attempt the second phase again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not allow any protracted period to occur in which you become preoccupied with irrelevant thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Return to the first phase of the exercises as often as necessary to prevent this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"445#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In applying today‚Äôs idea in the shorter practice periods, the form may vary according to the circumstances and situations in which you find yourself during the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you are with someone else, for example, try to remember to tell him silently:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"445#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God is my Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I cannot see you apart from Him.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"445#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This form is equally applicable to strangers as it is to those you think are closer to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In fact, try not to make distinctions of this kind at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"445#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today‚Äôs idea should also be applied throughout the day to various situations and events that may occur, particularly to those which seem to distress you in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this purpose, apply the idea in this form:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"445#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God is my Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I cannot see this apart from Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"445#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If no particular subject presents itself to your awareness at the time, merely repeat the idea in its original form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"445#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Try today not to allow any long periods of time to slip by without remembering today‚Äôs idea, and thus remembering your function.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Perception is not an attribute of God.
