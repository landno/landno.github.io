data-sentence-id=\"072#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have stated that the basic concepts referred to in this course are not matters of degree.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Certain fundamental concepts cannot be understood in terms of opposites.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is impossible to conceive of light and darkness or everything and nothing as joint possibilities.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are all true or all false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is essential that you realize your thinking will be erratic until a firm commitment to one or the other is made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A firm commitment to darkness or nothingness, however, is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one has ever lived who has not experienced <i>some</i> light and <i>some</i> thing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No one, therefore, is able to deny truth totally, even if he thinks he can.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"072#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Innocence is not a partial attribute.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not real <i>until</i> it is total.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The partly innocent are apt to be quite foolish at times.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is not until their innocence becomes a viewpoint with universal application that it becomes wisdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Innocent or true perception means that you never misperceive and always see truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>More simply, it means that you never see what does not exist, and always see what does.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"072#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you lack confidence in what someone will do, you are attesting to your belief that he is not in his right mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is hardly a miracle-based frame of reference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It also has the disastrous effect of denying the power of the miracle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle perceives everything as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If nothing but the truth exists, right-minded seeing cannot see anything but perfection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I have said that only what God creates or what you create with the same Will has any real existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This, then, is all the innocent can see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They do not suffer from distorted perception.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"072#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You are afraid of God’s Will because you have used your own mind, which He created in the likeness of His Own, to miscreate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The mind can miscreate only when it believes it is not free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>An “imprisoned” mind is not free because it is possessed, or held back, by itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is therefore limited, and the will is not free to assert itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To be one is to be of one mind or will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When the Will of the Sonship and the Father are one, their perfect accord is Heaven.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"072#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing can prevail against a Son of God who commends his spirit into the Hands of his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>By doing this the mind awakens from its sleep and remembers its Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All sense of separation disappears.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Son of God is part of the Holy Trinity, but the Trinity Itself is One.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>There is no confusion within Its Levels, because They are of one Mind and one Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This single purpose creates perfect integration and establishes the peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet this vision can be perceived only by the truly innocent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Because their hearts are pure, the innocent defend true perception instead of defending themselves against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Understanding the lesson of the Atonement they are without the wish to attack, and therefore they see truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This is what the Bible means when it says, “When he shall appear (or be perceived) we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"072#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The way to correct distortions is to withdraw your faith in them and invest it only in what is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot make untruth true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you are willing to accept what is true in everything you perceive, you let it be true for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Truth overcomes all error, and those who live in error and emptiness can never find lasting solace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you perceive truly you are cancelling out misperceptions in yourself and in others simultaneously.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Because you see them as they are, you offer them your acceptance of their truth so they can accept it for themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"072#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the healing that the miracle induces.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"I have stated that the basic concepts referred to in this
