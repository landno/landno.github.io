data-sentence-id=\"253#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have repeated how little is asked of you to learn this course.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the same small willingness you need to have your whole relationship transformed to joy; the little gift you offer to the Holy Spirit for which He gives you everything; the very little on which salvation rests; the tiny change of mind by which the crucifixion is changed to resurrection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And being true, it is so simple that it cannot fail to be completely understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Rejected yes, but not ambiguous.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And if you choose against it now it will not be because it is obscure, but rather that this little cost seemed, in your judgment, to be too much to pay for peace.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the only thing that you need do for vision, happiness, release from pain and the complete escape from sin, all to be given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Say only this, but mean it with no reservations, for here the power of salvation lies:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"253#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I <b>am</b> responsible for what I see.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I choose the feelings I experience, and I decide upon the goal I would achieve.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And everything that seems to happen to me I ask for, and receive as I have asked.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"253#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Deceive yourself no longer that you are helpless in the face of what is done to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Acknowledge but that you have been mistaken, and all effects of your mistakes will disappear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible the Son of God be merely driven by events outside of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is impossible that happenings that come to him were not his choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His power of decision is the determiner of every situation in which he seems to find himself by chance or accident.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No accident nor chance is possible within the universe as God created it, outside of which is nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Suffer, and you decided sin was your goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Be happy, and you gave the power of decision to Him Who must decide for God for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the little gift you offer to the Holy Spirit, and even this He gives to you to give yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For by this gift is given you the power to release your savior, that he may give salvation unto you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Begrudge not then this little offering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Withhold it, and you keep the world as now you see it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Give it away, and everything you see goes with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Never was so much given for so little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In the holy instant is this exchange effected and maintained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here is the world you do not want brought to the one you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And here the one you do is given you because you want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet for this, the power of your wanting must first be recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You must accept its strength, and not its weakness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You must perceive that what is strong enough to make a world can let it go, and can accept correction if it is willing to see that it was wrong.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The world you see is but the idle witness that you were right.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This witness is insane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You trained it in its testimony, and as it gave it back to you, you listened and convinced yourself that what it saw was true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You did this to yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>See only this, and you will also see how circular the reasoning on which your “seeing” rests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This was not given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This was your gift to you and to your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Be willing, then, to have it taken from him and be replaced with truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And as you look upon the change in him, it will be given you to see it in yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps you do not see the need for you to give this little offering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Look closer, then, at what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And, very simply, see in it the whole exchange of separation for salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All that the ego is, is an idea that it is possible that things could happen to the Son of God without his will; and thus without the Will of his Creator, Whose Will cannot be separate from his own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the Son of God’s replacement for his will, a mad revolt against what must forever be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the statement that he has the power to make God powerless and so to take it for himself, and leave himself without what God has willed for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is the mad idea you have enshrined upon your altars, and which you worship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And anything that threatens this seems to attack your faith, for here is it invested.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Think not that you are faithless, for your belief and trust in this is strong indeed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit can give you faith in holiness and vision to see it easily enough.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But you have not left open and unoccupied the altar where the gifts belong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Where they should be, you have set up your idols to something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This other “will,” which seems to tell you what must happen, you give reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And what would show you otherwise must therefore seem unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All that is asked of you is to make room for truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are not asked to make or do what lies beyond your understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>All you are asked to do is <i>let it in;</i> only to stop your interference with what will happen of itself; simply to recognize again the presence of what you thought you gave away.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be willing, for an instant, to leave your altars free of what you placed upon them, and what is really there you cannot fail to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The holy instant is not an instant of creation, but of recognition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For recognition comes of vision and suspended judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Then only it is possible to look within and see what must be there, plainly in sight, and wholly independent of inference and judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Undoing is not your task, but it <i>is</i> up to you to welcome it or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Faith and desire go hand in hand, for everyone believes in what he wants.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have already said that wishful thinking is how the ego deals with what it wants, to make it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no better demonstration of the power of wanting, and therefore of faith, to make its goals seem real and possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Faith in the unreal leads to adjustments of reality to make it fit the goal of madness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The goal of sin induces the perception of a fearful world to justify its purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you desire, you will see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And if its reality is false, you will uphold it by not realizing all the adjustments you have introduced to make it so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When vision is denied, confusion of cause and effect becomes inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The purpose now becomes to keep obscure the cause of the effect, and make effect appear to be a cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This seeming independence of effect enables it to be regarded as standing by itself, and capable of serving as a cause of the events and feelings its maker thinks it causes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Earlier, we spoke of your desire to create your own creator, and be father and not son to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the same desire.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Son is the Effect, whose Cause he would deny.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so he seems to <i>be</i> the cause, producing real effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Nothing can have effects without a cause, and to confuse the two is merely to fail to understand them both.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is as needful that you recognize you made the world you see, as that you recognize that you did not create yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span><i>They are the same mistake.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing created not by your Creator has any influence over you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And if you think what you have made can tell you what you see and feel, and place your faith in its ability to do so, you are denying your Creator and believing that you made yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For if you think the world you made has power to make you what it wills, you are confusing Son and Father; effect and Source.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Son’s creations are like his Father’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet in creating them the Son does not delude himself that he is independent of his Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His union with It is the source of his creating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Apart from this he has no power to create, and what he makes is meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It changes nothing in creation, depends entirely upon the madness of its maker, and cannot serve to justify the madness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your brother thinks he made the world with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Thus he denies creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>With you, he thinks the world he made, made him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Thus he denies he made it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"253#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet the truth is you and your brother were both created by a loving Father, Who created you together and as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>See what “proves” otherwise, and you deny your whole reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But grant that everything that seems to stand between you and your brother, keeping you from each other and separate from your Father, you made in secret, and the instant of release has come to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All its effects are gone, because its source has been uncovered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is its seeming independence of its source that keeps you prisoner.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"253#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the same mistake as thinking you are independent of the Source by which you were created, and have never left.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"We have repeated how
