data-sentence-id=\"246#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this world, God’s Son comes closest to himself in a holy relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There he begins to find the certainty his Father has in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And there he finds his function of restoring his Father’s laws to what was held outside them, and finding what was lost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only in time can anything be lost, and never lost forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>So do the parts of God’s Son gradually join in time, and with each joining is the end of time brought nearer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Each miracle of joining is a mighty herald of eternity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one who has a single purpose, unified and sure, can be afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No one who shares his purpose with him can <i>not</i> be one with him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"246#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Each herald of eternity sings of the end of sin and fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each speaks in time of what is far beyond it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Two voices raised together call to the hearts of everyone, to let them beat as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And in that single heartbeat is the unity of love proclaimed and given welcome.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Peace to your holy relationship, which has the power to hold the unity of the Son of God together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You give to your brother for everyone, and in your gift is everyone made glad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Forget not Who has given you the gifts you give, and through your not forgetting this, will you remember Who gave the gifts to Him to give to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"246#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible to overestimate your brother’s value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only the ego does this, but all it means is that it wants the other for itself, and therefore values him too little.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What is inestimable clearly cannot be evaluated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do you recognize the fear that rises from the meaningless attempt to judge what lies so far beyond your judgment you cannot even see it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Judge not what is invisible to you or you will never see it, but wait in patience for its coming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It will be given you to see your brother’s worth when all you want for him is peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And what you want for him you will receive.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"246#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can you estimate the worth of him who offers peace to you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What would you want except his offering?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His worth has been established by his Father, and you will recognize it as you receive his Father’s gift through him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is in him will shine so brightly in your grateful vision that you will merely love him and be glad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will not think to judge him, for who would see the face of Christ and yet insist that judgment still has meaning?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For this insistence is of those who do not see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Vision or judgment is your choice, but never both of these.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"246#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your brother’s body is as little use to you as it is to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When it is used only as the Holy Spirit teaches, it has no function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For minds need not the body to communicate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The sight that sees the body has no use which serves the purpose of a holy relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And while you look upon your brother thus, the means and end have not been brought in line.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Why should it take so many holy instants to let this be accomplished, when one would do?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There <i>is</i> but one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The little breath of eternity that runs through time like golden light is all the same; nothing before it, nothing afterwards.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"246#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You look upon each holy instant as a different point in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It never changes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>All that it ever held or will ever hold is here right now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The past takes nothing from it, and the future will add no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here, then, is everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here is the loveliness of your relationship, with means and end in perfect harmony already.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here is the perfect faith that you will one day offer to your brother already offered you; and here the limitless forgiveness you will give him already given, the face of Christ you yet will look upon already seen.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"246#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Can you evaluate the giver of a gift like this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you exchange this gift for any other?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This gift returns the laws of God to your remembrance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And merely by remembering them, the laws that held you prisoner to pain and death must be forgotten.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is no gift your brother’s body offers you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The veil that hides the gift hides him as well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He <i>is</i> the gift, and yet he knows it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>No more do you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And yet, have faith that He Who sees the gift in you and your brother will offer and receive it for you both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And through His vision will you see it, and through His understanding recognize it and love it as your own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"246#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be comforted, and feel the Holy Spirit watching over you in love and perfect confidence in what He sees.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He knows the Son of God, and shares his Father’s certainty the universe rests in his gentle hands in safety and in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let us consider now what he must learn, to share his Father’s confidence in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is he, that the Creator of the universe should offer it to him and know it rests in safety?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He looks upon himself not as his Father knows him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"246#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And yet it is impossible the confidence of God should be misplaced.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"In this world, God’s Son comes
