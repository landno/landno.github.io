data-sentence-id=\"292#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit can use all that you give to Him for your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But He cannot use what you withhold, for He cannot take it from you without your willingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For if He did, you would believe He wrested it from you against your will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so you would not learn it <i>is</i> your will to be without it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You need not give it to Him wholly willingly, for if you could you had no need of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But this He needs; that you prefer He take it than that you keep it for yourself alone, and recognize that what brings loss to no one you would not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This much is necessary to add to the idea no one can lose for you to gain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And nothing more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here is the only principle salvation needs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor is it necessary that your faith in it be strong, unswerving, and without attack from all beliefs opposed to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have no fixed allegiance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But remember salvation is not needed by the saved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are not called upon to do what one divided still against himself would find impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Have little faith that wisdom could be found in such a state of mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But be you thankful that only little faith is asked of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>What but a little faith remains to those who still believe in sin?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What could they know of Heaven and the justice of the saved?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a kind of justice in salvation of which the world knows nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To the world, justice and vengeance are the same, for sinners see justice only as their punishment, perhaps sustained by someone else, but not escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The laws of sin demand a victim.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who it may be makes little difference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But death must be the cost and must be paid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is not justice, but insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet how could justice be defined without insanity where love means hate, and death is seen as victory and triumph over eternity and timelessness and life?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who know not of justice still can ask, and learn the answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Justice looks on all in the same way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not just that one should lack for what another has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For that is vengeance in whatever form it takes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Justice demands no sacrifice, for any sacrifice is made that sin may be preserved and kept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is a payment offered for the cost of sin, but not the total cost.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The rest is taken from another, to be laid beside your little payment, to “atone” for all that you would keep, and not give up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>So is the victim seen as partly you, with someone else by far the greater part.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And in the total cost, the greater his the less is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And justice, being blind, is satisfied by being paid, it matters not by whom.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Can this be justice?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God knows not of this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But justice does He know, and knows it well.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For He is wholly fair to everyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Vengeance is alien to God’s Mind <i>because</i> He knows of justice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To be just is to be fair, and not be vengeful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Fairness and vengeance are impossible, for each one contradicts the other and denies that it is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is impossible for you to share the Holy Spirit’s justice with a mind that can conceive of specialness at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet how could He be just if He condemns a sinner for the crimes he did not do, but thinks he did?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And where would justice be if He demanded of the ones obsessed with the idea of punishment that they lay it aside, unaided, and perceive it is not true?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is extremely hard for those who still believe sin meaningful to understand the Holy Spirit’s justice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They must believe He shares their own confusion, and cannot avoid the vengeance that their own belief in justice must entail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And so they fear the Holy Spirit, and perceive the “wrath” of God in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Nor can they trust Him not to strike them dead with lightning bolts torn from the “fires” of Heaven by God’s Own angry Hand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They <i>do</i> believe that Heaven is hell, and <i>are</i> afraid of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And deep suspicion and the chill of fear comes over them when they are told that they have never sinned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Their world depends on sin’s stability.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And they perceive the “threat” of what God knows as justice to be more destructive to themselves and to their world than vengeance, which they understand and love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>So do they think the loss of sin a curse.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And flee the Holy Spirit as if He were a messenger from hell, sent from above, in treachery and guile, to work God’s vengeance on them in the guise of a deliverer and friend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What could He be to them except a devil, dressed to deceive within an angel’s cloak?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what escape has He for them except a door to hell that seems to look like Heaven’s gate?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet justice cannot punish those who ask for punishment, but have a Judge Who knows that they are wholly innocent in truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In justice He is bound to set them free, and give them all the honor they deserve and have denied themselves because they are not fair, and cannot understand that they are innocent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Love is not understandable to sinners because they think that justice is split off from love, and stands for something else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thus is love perceived as weak, and vengeance strong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For love has lost when judgment left its side, and is too weak to save from punishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But vengeance without love has gained in strength by being separate and apart from love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And what but vengeance now can help and save, while love stands feebly by with helpless hands, bereft of justice and vitality, and powerless to save?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What can Love ask of you who think that all of this is true?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Could He, in justice and in love, believe in your confusion you have much to give?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are not asked to trust Him far.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No more than what you see He offers you, and what you recognize you could not give yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In God’s Own justice does He recognize all you deserve, but understands as well that you cannot accept it for yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is His special function to hold out to you the gifts the innocent deserve.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And every one that you accept brings joy to Him as well as you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He knows that Heaven is richer made by each one you accept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And God rejoices as His Son receives what loving justice knows to be his due.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For love and justice are not different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span><i>Because</i> they are the same does mercy stand at God’s right Hand, and gives the Son of God the power to forgive himself of sin.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To him who merits everything, how can it be that anything be kept from him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For that would be injustice, and unfair indeed to all the holiness that is in him, however much he recognize it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God knows of no injustice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He would not allow His Son be judged by those who seek his death, and could not see his worth at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What honest witnesses could they call forth to speak on his behalf?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And who would come to plead for him, and not against his life?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No justice would be given him by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet God ensured that justice would be done unto the Son He loves, and would protect from all unfairness you might seek to offer, believing vengeance is his proper due.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>As specialness cares not who pays the cost of sin, so it be paid, the Holy Spirit heeds not who looks on innocence at last, provided it is seen and recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For just <i>one</i> witness is enough, if he sees truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Simple justice asks no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Of each one does the Holy Spirit ask if he will be that one, so justice may return to love and there be satisfied.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Each special function He allots is but for this; that each one learn that love and justice are not separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And both are strengthened by their union with each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Without love is justice prejudiced and weak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And love without justice is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For love is fair, and cannot chasten without cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>What cause can be to warrant an attack upon the innocent?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>In justice, then, does love correct mistakes, but not in vengeance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#11:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>For that would be unjust to innocence.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can be perfect witness to the power of love and justice, if you understand it is impossible the Son of God could merit vengeance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You need not perceive, in every circumstance, that this is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor need you look to your experience within the world, which is but shadows of all that is really happening within yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The understanding that you need comes not of you, but from a larger Self, so great and holy that He could not doubt His innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your special function is a call to Him, that He may smile on you whose sinlessness He shares.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His understanding will be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so the Holy Spirit’s special function has been fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God’s Son has found a witness unto his sinlessness and not his sins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>How little need you give the Holy Spirit that simple justice may be given you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

class=\"snr\">2</span>How can specialness be just?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Judge not because you cannot, not because you are a miserable sinner too.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How can the special really understand that justice is the same for everyone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To take from one to give another must be an injustice to them both, since they are equal in the Holy Spirit’s sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Their Father gave the same inheritance to both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Who would have more or less is not aware that he has everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#13:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is no judge of what must be another’s due, because he thinks he is deprived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#13:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And so must he be envious, and try to take away from whom he judges.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#13:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He is not impartial, and cannot fairly see another’s rights because his own have been obscured to him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"292#14\"><p

from all effects of sin, and to the life eternal, joyous and complete in every way, as God appointed for His holy Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"292#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is
