data-sentence-id=\"114#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have said that without projection there can be no anger, but it is also true that without extension there can be no love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These reflect a fundamental law of the mind, and therefore one that always operates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the law by which you create and were created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the law that unifies the Kingdom, and keeps it in the Mind of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To the ego, the law is perceived as a means of getting rid of something it does not want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To the Holy Spirit, it is the fundamental law of sharing, by which you give what you value in order to keep it in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To the Holy Spirit it is the law of extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To the ego it is the law of deprivation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It therefore produces abundance or scarcity, depending on how you choose to apply it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This choice is up to you, but it is not up to you to decide whether or not you will utilize the law.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Every mind must project or extend, because that is how it lives, and every mind is life.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"114#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego’s use of projection must be fully understood before the inevitable association between projection and anger can be finally undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego always tries to preserve conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is very ingenious in devising ways that seem to diminish conflict, because it does not want you to find conflict so intolerable that you will insist on giving it up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego therefore tries to persuade you that <i>it</i> can free you of conflict, lest you give the ego up and free yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Using its own warped version of the laws of God, the ego utilizes the power of the mind only to defeat the mind’s real purpose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It projects conflict from your mind to other minds, in an attempt to persuade you that you have gotten rid of the problem.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"114#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There are two major errors involved in this attempt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>First, strictly speaking, conflict cannot be projected because it cannot be shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Any attempt to keep part of it and get rid of another part does not really mean anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Remember that a conflicted teacher is a poor teacher and a poor learner.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His lessons are confused, and their transfer value is limited by his confusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The second error is the idea that you can get rid of something you do not want by giving it away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Giving it is how you <i>keep</i> it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The belief that by seeing it outside you have excluded it from within is a complete distortion of the power of extension.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That is why those who project are vigilant for their own safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>They are afraid that their projections will return and hurt them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Believing they have blotted their projections from their own minds, they also believe their projections are trying to creep back in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Since the projections have not left their minds, they are forced to engage in constant activity in order not to recognize this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"114#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot perpetuate an illusion about another without perpetuating it about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no way out of this, because it is impossible to fragment the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To fragment is to break into pieces, and mind cannot attack or be attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The belief that it can, an error the ego always makes, underlies its whole use of projection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It does not understand what mind is, and therefore does not understand what <i>you</i> are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet its existence is dependent on your mind, because the ego is your belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ego is a confusion in identification.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Never having had a consistent model, it never developed consistently.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is the product of the misapplication of the laws of God by distorted minds that are misusing their power.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"114#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span><i>Do not be afraid of the ego.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It depends on your mind, and as you made it by believing in it, so you can dispel it by withdrawing belief from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not project the responsibility for your belief in it onto anyone else, or you will preserve the belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you are willing to accept sole responsibility for the ego’s existence you will have laid aside all anger and all attack, because they come from an attempt to project responsibility for your own errors.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But having accepted the errors as yours, do not keep them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Give them over quickly to the Holy Spirit to be undone completely, so that all their effects will vanish from your mind and from the Sonship as a whole.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"114#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit will teach you to perceive beyond your belief, because truth is beyond belief and His perception is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego can be completely forgotten at any time, because it is a totally incredible belief, and no one can keep a belief he has judged to be unbelievable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The more you learn about the ego, the more you realize that it cannot be believed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The incredible cannot be understood because it is unbelievable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The meaninglessness of perception based on the unbelievable is apparent, but it may not be recognized as being beyond belief, because it is made <i>by</i> belief.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"114#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The whole purpose of this course is to teach you that the ego is unbelievable and will forever be unbelievable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You who made the ego by believing the unbelievable cannot make this judgment alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By accepting the Atonement for yourself, you are deciding against the belief that you can be alone, thus dispelling the idea of separation and affirming your true identification with the whole Kingdom as literally part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This identification is as beyond doubt as it is beyond belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"114#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your wholeness has no limits because being is infinity.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"We have said that without projection there can
