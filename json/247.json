data-sentence-id=\"247#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The meaning of the Son of God lies solely in his relationship with his Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If it were elsewhere it would rest on contingency, but there <i>is</i> nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this is wholly loving and forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet has the Son of God invented an unholy relationship between him and his Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His real relationship is one of perfect union and unbroken continuity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The one he made is partial, self-centered, broken into fragments and full of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The one created by his Father is wholly Self-encompassing and Self-extending.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The one he made is wholly self-destructive and self-limiting.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Nothing can show the contrast better than the experience of both a holy and an unholy relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The first is based on love, and rests on it serene and undisturbed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body does not intrude upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Any relationship in which the body enters is based not on love, but on idolatry.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Love wishes to be known, completely understood and shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It has no secrets; nothing that it would keep apart and hide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It walks in sunlight, open-eyed and calm, in smiling welcome and in sincerity so simple and so obvious it cannot be misunderstood.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>But idols do not share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Idols accept, but never make return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They can be loved, but cannot love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They do not understand what they are offered, and any relationship in which they enter has lost its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The love of them has made love meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They live in secrecy, hating the sunlight and happy in the body’s darkness, where they can hide and keep their secrets hidden along with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And they have no relationships, for no one else is welcome there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They smile on no one, and those who smile on them they do not see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Love has no darkened temples where mysteries are kept obscure and hidden from the sun.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It does not seek for power, but for relationships.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body is the ego’s chosen weapon for seeking power <i>through</i> relationships.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And its relationships must be unholy, for what they are it does not even see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It wants them solely for the offerings on which its idols thrive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The rest it merely throws away, for all that it could offer is seen as valueless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Homeless, the ego seeks as many bodies as it can collect to place its idols in, and so establish them as temples to itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s temple is not a body, but a relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The body is an isolated speck of darkness; a hidden secret room, a tiny spot of senseless mystery, a meaningless enclosure carefully protected, yet hiding nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here the unholy relationship escapes reality, and seeks for crumbs to keep itself alive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here it would drag its brothers, holding them here in its idolatry.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here it is “safe,” for here love cannot enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit does not build His temples where love can never be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Would He Who sees the face of Christ choose as His home the only place in all the universe where it can not be seen?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You cannot make the body the Holy Spirit’s temple, and it will never be the seat of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the home of the idolater, and of love’s condemnation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For here is love made fearful and hope abandoned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Even the idols that are worshipped here are shrouded in mystery, and kept apart from those who worship them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the temple dedicated to no relationships and no return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here is the “mystery” of separation perceived in awe and held in reverence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What God would have <i>not</i> be is here kept “safe” from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But what you do not realize is what you fear within your brother, and would not see in him, is what makes God seem fearful to you, and kept unknown.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Idolaters will always be afraid of love, for nothing so severely threatens them as love’s approach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let love draw near them and overlook the body, as it will surely do, and they retreat in fear, feeling the seeming firm foundation of their temple begin to shake and loosen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Brother, you tremble with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet what you fear is but the herald of escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This place of darkness is not your home.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your temple is not threatened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You are an idolater no longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Holy Spirit’s purpose lies safe in your relationship, and not your body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You have escaped the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Where you are the body cannot enter, for the Holy Spirit has set His temple there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no order in relationships.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They either are or not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>An unholy relationship is no relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is a state of isolation, which seems to be what it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No more than that.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The instant that the mad idea of making your relationship with God unholy seemed to be possible, all your relationships were made meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>In that unholy instant time was born, and bodies made to house the mad idea and give it the illusion of reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so it seemed to have a home that held together for a little while in time, and vanished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>For what could house this mad idea against reality but for an instant?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Idols must disappear, and leave no trace behind their going.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The unholy instant of their seeming power is frail as is a snowflake, but without its loveliness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Is this the substitute you want for the eternal blessing of the holy instant and its unlimited beneficence?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is the malevolence of the unholy relationship, so seeming powerful and so bitterly misunderstood and so invested in a false attraction your preference to the holy instant, which offers you peace and understanding?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Then lay aside the body and quietly transcend it, rising to welcome what you really want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And from His holy temple, look you not back on what you have awakened from.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For no illusions can attract the mind that has transcended them, and left them far behind.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The holy relationship reflects the true relationship the Son of God has with his Father in reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit rests within it in the certainty it will endure forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its firm foundation is eternally upheld by truth, and love shines on it with the gentle smile and tender blessing it offers to its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here the unholy instant is exchanged in gladness for the holy one of safe return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here is the way to true relationships held gently open, through which you and your brother walk together, leaving the body thankfully behind and resting in the Everlasting Arms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Love’s Arms are open to receive you, and give you peace forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"247#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body is the ego’s idol; the belief in sin made flesh and then projected outward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This produces what seems to be a wall of flesh around the mind, keeping it prisoner in a tiny spot of space and time, beholden unto death, and given but an instant in which to sigh and grieve and die in honor of its master.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this unholy instant seems to be life; an instant of despair, a tiny island of dry sand, bereft of water and set uncertainly upon oblivion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here does the Son of God stop briefly by, to offer his devotion to death’s idols and then pass on.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And here he is more dead than living.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it is also here he makes his choice again between idolatry and love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here it is given him to choose to spend this instant paying tribute to the body, or let himself be given freedom from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Here he can accept the holy instant, offered him to replace the unholy one he chose before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And here can he learn relationships are his salvation, and not his doom.</span></p></div> <div

fearful, but you are not immobilized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The holy instant is of greater value now to you than its unholy seeming counterpart, and you have learned you really want but one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is no time for sadness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perhaps confusion, but hardly discouragement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have a <i>real</i> relationship, and it has meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is as like your real relationship with God as equal things are like unto each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Idolatry is past and meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Perhaps you fear your brother a little yet; perhaps a shadow of the fear of God remains with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet what is that to those who have been given one true relationship beyond the body?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Can they be long held back from looking on the face of Christ?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"247#12:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And can they long withhold the memory of their relationship with their Father from themselves, and keep remembrance of His Love apart from their awareness?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The meaning of the Son of God lies solely in his relationship with his Creator.
