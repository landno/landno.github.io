Knowledge","inlineNumber":"III."},"annotation":"T-3.III","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-3-sect-3\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"073#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We have been emphasizing perception, and have said very little about knowledge as yet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is because perception must be straightened out before you can know anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To know is to be certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Uncertainty means that you do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Knowledge is power because it is certain, and certainty is strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perception is temporary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As an attribute of the belief in space and time, it is subject to either fear or love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Misperceptions produce fear and true perceptions foster love, but neither brings certainty because all perception varies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>That is why it is not knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>True perception is the basis for knowledge, but knowing is the affirmation of truth and beyond all perceptions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"073#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All your difficulties stem from the fact that you do not recognize yourself, your brother or God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To recognize means to “know again,” implying that you knew before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You can see in many ways because perception involves interpretation, and this means that it is not whole or consistent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle, being a way of perceiving, is not knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the right answer to a question, but you do not question when you know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Questioning illusions is the first step in undoing them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The miracle, or the right answer, corrects them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Since perceptions change, their dependence on time is obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>How you perceive at any given time determines what you do, and actions must occur in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Knowledge is timeless, because certainty is not questionable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You know when you have ceased to ask questions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"073#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The questioning mind perceives itself in time, and therefore looks for future answers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The closed mind believes the future and the present will be the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This establishes a seemingly stable state that is usually an attempt to counteract an underlying fear that the future will be worse than the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This fear inhibits the tendency to question at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"073#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>True vision is the natural perception of spiritual sight, but it is still a correction rather than a fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Spiritual sight is symbolic, and therefore not a device for knowing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is, however, a means of right perception, which brings it into the proper domain of the miracle.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A “vision of God” would be a miracle rather than a revelation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The fact that perception is involved at all removes the experience from the realm of knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>That is why visions, however holy, do not last.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"073#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Bible tells you to know yourself, or to be certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Certainty is always of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you love someone you have perceived him as he is, and this makes it possible for you to know him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Until you first perceive him as he is you cannot know him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>While you ask questions about him you are clearly implying that you do not know God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Certainty does not require action.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When you say you are acting on the basis of knowledge, you are really confusing knowledge with perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Knowledge provides the strength for creative thinking, but not for right doing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Perception, miracles and doing are closely related.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Knowledge is the result of revelation and induces only thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Even in its most spiritualized form perception involves the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Knowledge comes from the altar within and is timeless because it is certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#5:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>To perceive the truth is not the same as to know it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"073#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Right perception is necessary before God can communicate directly to His altars, which He established in His Sons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There He can communicate His certainty, and His knowledge will bring peace without question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God is not a stranger to His Sons, and His Sons are not strangers to each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Knowledge preceded both perception and time, and will ultimately replace them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is the real meaning of “Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,” and “Before Abraham was I am.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perception can and must be stabilized, but knowledge <i>is</i> stable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>“Fear God and keep His commandments” becomes “Know God and accept His certainty.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"073#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you attack error in another, you will hurt yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot know your brother when you attack him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Attack is always made upon a stranger.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are making him a stranger by misperceiving him, and so you cannot know him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is because you have made him a stranger that you are afraid of him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Perceive him correctly so that you can know him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There are no strangers in God’s creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To create as He created you can create only what you know, and therefore accept as yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>God knows His children with perfect certainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>He created them by knowing them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>He recognizes them perfectly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"073#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>When they do not recognize each other, they do not recognize Him.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"We have been emphasizing perception, and have said very little about
