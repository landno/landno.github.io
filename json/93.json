Guilt","inlineNumber":"V."},"annotation":"T-5.V","bodyHtml":"<div class=\"acim-text chap-5-sect-5\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"093#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps some of our concepts will become clearer and more personally meaningful if the ego’s use of guilt is clarified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego has a purpose, just as the Holy Spirit has.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego’s purpose is fear, because only the fearful can be egotistic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego’s logic is as impeccable as that of the Holy Spirit, because your mind has the means at its disposal to side with Heaven or earth, as it elects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But again, remember that both are in you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"093#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In Heaven there is no guilt, because the Kingdom is attained through the Atonement, which releases you to create.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The word “create” is appropriate here because, once what you have made is undone by the Holy Spirit, the blessed residue is restored and therefore continues in creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What is truly blessed is incapable of giving rise to guilt, and must give rise to joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This makes it invulnerable to the ego because its peace is unassailable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is invulnerable to disruption because it is whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Guilt is <i>always</i> disruptive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Anything that engenders fear is divisive because it obeys the law of division.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If the ego is the symbol of the separation, it is also the symbol of guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Guilt is more than merely not of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is the symbol of attack on God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This is a totally meaningless concept except to the ego, but do not underestimate the power of the ego’s belief in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#2:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>This is the belief from which all guilt really stems.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"093#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego is the part of the mind that believes in division.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How could part of God detach itself without believing it is attacking Him?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We spoke before of the authority problem as based on the concept of usurping God’s power.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego believes that this is what you did because it believes that it <i>is</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you identify with the ego, you must perceive yourself as guilty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Whenever you respond to your ego you will experience guilt, and you will fear punishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The ego is quite literally a fearful thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>However ridiculous the idea of attacking God may be to the sane mind, never forget that the ego is not sane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It represents a delusional system, and speaks for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Listening to the ego’s voice means that you believe it is possible to attack God, and that a part of Him has been torn away by you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Fear of retaliation from without follows, because the severity of the guilt is so acute that it must be projected.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"093#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Whatever you accept into your mind has reality for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is your acceptance of it that makes it real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you enthrone the ego in your mind, your allowing it to enter makes it your reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is because the mind is capable of creating reality or making illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I said before that you must learn to think with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To think with Him is to think like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This engenders joy, not guilt, because it is natural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Guilt is a sure sign that your thinking is unnatural.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Unnatural thinking will always be attended with guilt, because it is the belief in sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The ego does not perceive sin as a lack of love, but as a positive act of assault.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This is necessary to the ego’s survival because, as soon as you regard sin as a lack, you will automatically attempt to remedy the situation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And you will succeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#4:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>The ego regards this as doom, but you must learn to regard it as freedom.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"093#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The guiltless mind cannot suffer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Being sane, the mind heals the body because <i>it</i> has been healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The sane mind cannot conceive of illness because it cannot conceive of attacking anyone or anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I said before that illness is a form of magic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It might be better to say that it is a form of magical solution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego believes that by punishing itself it will mitigate the punishment of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet even in this it is arrogant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It attributes to God a punishing intent, and then takes this intent as its own prerogative.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It tries to usurp all the functions of God as it perceives them, because it recognizes that only total allegiance can be trusted.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"093#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego cannot oppose the laws of God any more than you can, but it can interpret them according to what it wants, just as you can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is why the question, “What do you want?” must be answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are answering it every minute and every second, and each moment of decision is a judgment that is anything but ineffectual.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its effects will follow automatically until the decision is changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember, though, that the alternatives themselves are unalterable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Holy Spirit, like the ego, is a decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Together they constitute all the alternatives the mind can accept and obey.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The Holy Spirit and the ego are the only choices open to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>God created one, and so you cannot eradicate it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You made the other, and so you can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Only what God creates is irreversible and unchangeable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>What you made can always be changed because, when you do not think like God, you are not really thinking at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Delusional ideas are not real thoughts, although you can believe in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>But you are wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>The function of thought comes from God and is in God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#6:16\"><span class=\"snr\">16</span>As part of His Thought, you <i>cannot</i> think apart from Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"093#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Irrational thought is disordered thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God Himself orders your thought because your thought was created by Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Guilt feelings are always a sign that you do not know this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They also show that you believe you can think apart from God, and want to.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Every disordered thought is attended by guilt at its inception, and maintained by guilt in its continuance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Guilt is inescapable by those who believe they order their own thoughts, and must therefore obey their dictates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This makes them feel responsible for their errors without recognizing that, by accepting this responsibility, they are reacting irresponsibly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If the sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself, and I assure you that it is, then the responsibility for <i>what</i> is atoned for cannot be yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The dilemma cannot be resolved except by accepting the solution of undoing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You <i>would</i> be responsible for the effects of all your wrong thinking if it could not be undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The purpose of the Atonement is to save the past in purified form only.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>If you accept the remedy for disordered thought, a remedy whose efficacy is beyond doubt, how can its symptoms remain?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"093#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The continuing decision to remain separated is the only possible reason for continuing guilt feelings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We have said this before, but did not emphasize the destructive results of the decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Any decision of the mind will affect both behavior and experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What you want you expect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is not delusional.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your mind <i>does</i> make your future, and it will turn it back to full creation at any minute if it accepts the Atonement first.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It will also return to full creation the instant it has done so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"093#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Having given up its disordered thought, the proper ordering of thought becomes quite apparent.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Perhaps some of our concepts will become clearer and more personally meaningful if the ego’s use of guilt is clarified.
