data-sentence-id=\"159#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Only love is strong because it is undivided.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The strong do not attack because they see no need to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Before the idea of attack can enter your mind, you must have perceived yourself as weak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Because you attacked yourself and believed that the attack was effective, you behold yourself as weakened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No longer perceiving yourself and your brothers as equal, and regarding yourself as weaker, you attempt to “equalize” the situation you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You use attack to do so because you believe that attack was successful in weakening you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"159#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That is why the recognition of your own invulnerability is so important to the restoration of your sanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For if you accept your invulnerability, you are recognizing that attack has no effect.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Although you have attacked yourself, you will be demonstrating that nothing really happened.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Therefore, by attacking you have not done anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Once you realize this you will no longer see any sense in attack, for it manifestly does not work and cannot protect you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet the recognition of your invulnerability has more than negative value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If your attacks on yourself have failed to weaken you, you are still strong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You therefore have no need to “equalize” the situation to establish your strength.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"159#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You will never realize the utter uselessness of attack except by recognizing that your attack on yourself has no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For others do react to attack if they perceive it, and if you are trying to attack them you will be unable to avoid interpreting this as reinforcement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The only place you can cancel out all reinforcement is in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For you are always the first point of your attack, and if this has never been, it has no consequences.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"159#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit’s Love is your strength, for yours is divided and therefore not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot trust your own love when you attack it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You cannot learn of perfect love with a split mind, because a split mind has made itself a poor learner.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You tried to make the separation eternal, because you wanted to retain the characteristics of creation, but with your own content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet creation is not of you, and poor learners do need special teaching.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"159#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have learning handicaps in a very literal sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There are areas in your learning skills that are so impaired that you can progress only under constant, clear-cut direction, provided by a Teacher Who can transcend your limited resources.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He becomes your Resource because of yourself you cannot learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The learning situation in which you placed yourself is impossible, and in this situation you clearly require a special Teacher and a special curriculum.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Poor learners are not good choices as teachers, either for themselves or for anyone else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You would hardly turn to them to establish the curriculum by which they can escape from their limitations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If they understood what is beyond them, they would not be handicapped.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"159#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not know the meaning of love, and that is your handicap.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not attempt to teach yourself what you do not understand, and do not try to set up curriculum goals where yours have clearly failed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your learning goal has been <i>not</i> to learn, and this cannot lead to successful learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot transfer what you have not learned, and the impairment of the ability to generalize is a crucial learning failure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would you ask those who have failed to learn what learning aids are for?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If they could interpret the aids correctly, they would have learned from them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"159#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have said that the ego’s rule is, “Seek and do not find.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Translated into curricular terms this means, “Try to learn but do not succeed.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The result of this curriculum goal is obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Every legitimate teaching aid, every real instruction, and every sensible guide to learning will be misinterpreted, since they are all for facilitating the learning this strange curriculum is against.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If you are trying to learn how not to learn, and the aim of your teaching is to defeat itself, what can you expect but confusion?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Such a curriculum does not make sense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This attempt at “learning” has so weakened your mind that you cannot love, for the curriculum you have chosen is against love, and amounts to a course in how to attack yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>A supplementary goal in this curriculum is learning how <i>not</i> to overcome the split that makes its primary aim believable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And you will not overcome the split in this curriculum, for all your learning will be on its behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Yet your mind speaks against your learning as your learning speaks against your mind, and so you fight against all learning and succeed, for that is what you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>But perhaps you do not realize, even yet, that there is something you want to learn, and that you can learn it because it <i>is</i> your choice to do so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"159#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who have tried to learn what you do not want should take heart, for although the curriculum you set yourself is depressing indeed, it is merely ridiculous if you look at it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is it possible that the way to achieve a goal is not to attain it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Resign now as your own teacher.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This resignation will not lead to depression.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is merely the result of an honest appraisal of what you have taught yourself, and of the learning outcomes that have resulted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Under the proper learning conditions, which you can neither provide nor understand, you will become an excellent learner and an excellent teacher.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But it is not so yet, and will not be so until the whole learning situation as you have set it up is reversed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"159#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your learning potential, properly understood, is limitless because it will lead you to God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can teach the way to Him and learn it, if you follow the Teacher Who knows the way to Him and understands His curriculum for learning it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The curriculum is totally unambiguous, because the goal is not divided and the means and the end are in complete accord.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You need offer only undivided attention.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Everything else will be given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For you really want to learn aright, and nothing can oppose the decision of God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"159#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His learning is as unlimited as he is.</span></p></div>
