data-sentence-id=\"823#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The belief in order of difficulties is the basis for the world’s perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It rests on differences; on uneven background and shifting foreground, on unequal heights and diverse sizes, on varying degrees of darkness and light, and thousands of contrasts in which each thing seen competes with every other in order to be recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>A larger object overshadows a smaller one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>A brighter thing draws the attention from another with less intensity of appeal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And a more threatening idea, or one conceived of as more desirable by the world’s standards, completely upsets the mental balance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What the body’s eyes behold is only conflict.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Look not to them for peace and understanding.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"823#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Illusions are always illusions of differences.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>How could it be otherwise?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>By definition, an illusion is an attempt to make something real that is regarded as of major importance, but is recognized as being untrue.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The mind therefore seeks to make it true out of its intensity of desire to have it for itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Illusions are travesties of creation; attempts to bring truth to lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Finding truth unacceptable, the mind revolts against truth and gives itself an illusion of victory.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Finding health a burden, it retreats into feverish dreams.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And in these dreams the mind is separate, different from other minds, with different interests of its own, and able to gratify its needs at the expense of others.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"823#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Where do all these differences come from?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Certainly they seem to be in the world outside.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it is surely the mind that judges what the eyes behold.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the mind that interprets the eyes’ messages and gives them “meaning.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this meaning does not exist in the world outside at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>What is seen as “reality” is simply what the mind prefers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Its hierarchy of values is projected outward, and it sends the body’s eyes to find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The body’s eyes will never see except through differences.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet it is not the messages they bring on which perception rests.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Only the mind evaluates their messages, and so only the mind is responsible for seeing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>It alone decides whether what is seen is real or illusory, desirable or undesirable, pleasurable or painful.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"823#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is in the sorting out and categorizing activities of the mind that errors in perception enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it is here correction must be made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The mind classifies what the body’s eyes bring to it according to its preconceived values, judging where each sense datum fits best.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What basis could be faultier than this?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Unrecognized by itself, it has itself asked to be given what will fit into these categories.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And having done so, it concludes that the categories must be true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>On this the judgment of all differences rests, because it is on this that judgments of the world depend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Can this confused and senseless “reasoning” be depended on for anything?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"823#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There can be no order of difficulty in healing merely because all sickness is illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Is it harder to dispel the belief of the insane in a larger hallucination as opposed to a smaller one?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Will he agree more quickly to the unreality of a louder voice he hears than to that of a softer one?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Will he dismiss more easily a whispered demand to kill than a shout?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And do the number of pitchforks the devils he sees carrying affect their credibility in his perception?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His mind has categorized them all as real, and so they are all real to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When he realizes they are all illusions they will disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And so it is with healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The properties of illusions which seem to make them different are really irrelevant, for their properties are as illusory as they are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"823#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body’s eyes will continue to see differences.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But the mind that has let itself be healed will no longer acknowledge them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There will be those who seem to be “sicker” than others, and the body’s eyes will report their changed appearances as before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But the healed mind will put them all in one category; they are unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is the gift of its Teacher; the understanding that only two categories are meaningful in sorting out the messages the mind receives from what appears to be the outside world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And of these two, but one is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Just as reality is wholly real, apart from size and shape and time and place—for differences cannot exist within it—so too are illusions without distinctions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The one answer to sickness of any kind is healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"823#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The one answer to all illusions is truth.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The belief in order of difficulties is the basis for the world’s perception.
