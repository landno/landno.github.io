data-sentence-id=\"168#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And now the reason why you are afraid of this course should be apparent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For this is a course on love, because it is about you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have been told that your function in this world is healing, and your function in Heaven is creating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The ego teaches that your function on earth is destruction, and you have no function at all in Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It would thus destroy you here and bury you here, leaving you no inheritance except the dust out of which it thinks you were made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As long as it is reasonably satisfied with you, as its reasoning goes, it offers you oblivion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>When it becomes overtly savage, it offers you hell.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"168#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet neither oblivion nor hell is as unacceptable to you as Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Your definition of Heaven <i>is</i> hell and oblivion, and the real Heaven is the greatest threat you think you could experience.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For hell and oblivion are ideas that you made up, and you are bent on demonstrating their reality to establish yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If their reality is questioned, you believe that yours is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For you believe that attack is your reality, and that your destruction is the final proof that you were right.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"168#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Under the circumstances, would it not be more desirable to have been wrong, even apart from the fact that you were wrong?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>While it could perhaps be argued that death suggests there <i>was</i> life, no one would claim that it proves there <i>is</i> life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Even the past life that death might indicate, could only have been futile if it must come to this, and needs this to prove that it was at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You question Heaven, but you do not question this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you could heal and be healed if you did question it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And even though you know not Heaven, might it not be more desirable than death?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have been as selective in your questioning as in your perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>An open mind is more honest than this.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"168#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego has a strange notion of time, and it is with this notion that your questioning might well begin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego invests heavily in the past, and in the end believes that the past is the only aspect of time that is meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember that its emphasis on guilt enables it to ensure its continuity by making the future like the past, and thus avoiding the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By the notion of paying for the past in the future, the past becomes the determiner of the future, making them continuous without an intervening present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For the ego regards the present only as a brief transition to the future, in which it brings the past to the future by interpreting the present in past terms.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"168#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>“Now” has no meaning to the ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The present merely reminds it of past hurts, and it reacts to the present as if it <i>were</i> the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego cannot tolerate release from the past, and although the past is over, the ego tries to preserve its image by responding as if it were present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It dictates your reactions to those you meet in the present from a past reference point, obscuring their present reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In effect, if you follow the ego’s dictates you will react to your brother as though he were someone else, and this will surely prevent you from recognizing him as he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you will receive messages from him out of your own past because, by making it real in the present, you are forbidding yourself to let it go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You thus deny yourself the message of release that every brother offers you <i>now.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"168#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The shadowy figures from the past are precisely what you must escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are not real, and have no hold over you unless you bring them with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They carry the spots of pain in your mind, directing you to attack in the present in retaliation for a past that is no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And this decision is one of future pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Unless you learn that past pain is an illusion, you are choosing a future of illusions and losing the many opportunities you could find for release in the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego would preserve your nightmares, and prevent you from awakening and understanding they are past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Would you recognize a holy encounter if you are merely perceiving it as a meeting with your own past?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For you would be meeting no one, and the sharing of salvation, which makes the encounter holy, would be excluded from your sight.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The Holy Spirit teaches that you always meet yourself, and the encounter is holy because you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The ego teaches that you always encounter your past, and because your dreams were not holy, the future cannot be, and the present is without meaning.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"168#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is evident that the Holy Spirit’s perception of time is the exact opposite of the ego’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The reason is equally clear, for they perceive the goal of time as diametrically opposed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit interprets time’s purpose as rendering the need for time unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He regards the function of time as temporary, serving only His teaching function, which is temporary by definition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His emphasis is therefore on the only aspect of time that can extend to the infinite, for <i>now</i> is the closest approximation of eternity that this world offers.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is in the reality of “now,” without past or future, that the beginning of the appreciation of eternity lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For only “now” is here, and only “now” presents the opportunities for the holy encounters in which salvation can be found.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"168#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego, on the other hand, regards the function of time as one of extending itself in place of eternity, for like the Holy Spirit, the ego interprets the goal of time as its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The continuity of past and future, under its direction, is the only purpose the ego perceives in time, and it closes over the present so that no gap in its own continuity can occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its continuity, then, would keep you in time, while the Holy Spirit would release you from it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is His interpretation of the means of salvation that you must learn to accept, if you would share His goal of salvation for you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"168#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You, too, will interpret the function of time as you interpret yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you accept your function in the world of time as one of healing, you will emphasize only the aspect of time in which healing can occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Healing cannot be accomplished in the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It must be accomplished in the present to release the future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This interpretation ties the future to the present, and extends the present rather than the past.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But if you interpret your function as destruction, you will lose sight of the present and hold on to the past to ensure a destructive future.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"168#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And time will be as you interpret it, for of itself it is nothing.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"And now the reason why you are afraid of this course should be apparent.
