class=\"acim-text chap-2-sect-6\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"067#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Being afraid seems to be involuntary; something beyond your own control.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet I have said already that only constructive acts should be involuntary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>My control can take over everything that does not matter, while my guidance can direct everything that does, if you so choose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Fear cannot be controlled by me, but it can be self-controlled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Fear prevents me from giving you my control.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The presence of fear shows that you have raised body thoughts to the level of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This removes them from my control, and makes you feel personally responsible for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is an obvious confusion of levels.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"067#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I do not foster level confusion, but you must choose to correct it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You would not excuse insane behavior on your part by saying you could not help it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Why should you condone insane thinking?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is a confusion here that you would do well to look at clearly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You may believe that you are responsible for what you do, but not for what you think.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The truth is that you are responsible for what you think, because it is only at this level that you can exercise choice.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What you do comes from what you think.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You cannot separate yourself from the truth by “giving” autonomy to behavior.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is controlled by me automatically as soon as you place what you think under my guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Whenever you are afraid, it is a sure sign that you have allowed your mind to miscreate and have not allowed me to guide it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"067#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is pointless to believe that controlling the outcome of misthought can result in healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you are fearful, you have chosen wrongly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is why you feel responsible for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You must change your mind, not your behavior, and this <i>is</i> a matter of willingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not need guidance except at the mind level.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Correction belongs only at the level where change is possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Change does not mean anything at the symptom level, where it cannot work.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"067#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The correction of fear <i>is</i> your responsibility.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you ask for release from fear, you are implying that it is not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You should ask, instead, for help in the conditions that have brought the fear about.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>These conditions always entail a willingness to be separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>At that level you <i>can</i> help it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are much too tolerant of mind wandering, and are passively condoning your mind’s miscreations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The particular result does not matter, but the fundamental error does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The correction is always the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Before you choose to do anything, ask me if your choice is in accord with mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If you are sure that it is, there will be no fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"067#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Fear is always a sign of strain, arising whenever what you want conflicts with what you do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This situation arises in two ways: First, you can choose to do conflicting things, either simultaneously or successively.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This produces conflicted behavior, which is intolerable to you because the part of the mind that wants to do something else is outraged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Second, you can behave as you think you should, but without entirely wanting to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This produces consistent behavior, but entails great strain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In both cases, the mind and the behavior are out of accord, resulting in a situation in which you are doing what you do not wholly want to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This arouses a sense of coercion that usually produces rage, and projection is likely to follow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Whenever there is fear, it is because you have not made up your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your mind is therefore split, and your behavior inevitably becomes erratic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Correcting at the behavioral level can shift the error from the first to the second type, but will not obliterate the fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"067#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is possible to reach a state in which you bring your mind under my guidance without conscious effort, but this implies a willingness that you have not developed as yet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit cannot ask more than you are willing to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The strength to do comes from your undivided decision.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There is no strain in doing God’s Will as soon as you recognize that it is also your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The lesson here is quite simple, but particularly apt to be overlooked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I will therefore repeat it, urging you to listen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only your mind can produce fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It does so whenever it is conflicted in what it wants, producing inevitable strain because wanting and doing are discordant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This can be corrected only by accepting a unified goal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"067#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The first corrective step in undoing the error is to know first that the conflict is an expression of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Say to yourself that you must somehow have chosen not to love, or the fear could not have arisen.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then the whole process of correction becomes nothing more than a series of pragmatic steps in the larger process of accepting the Atonement as the remedy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>These steps may be summarized in this way:<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Know first that this is fear.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Fear arises from lack of love.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The only remedy for lack of love is perfect love.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Perfect love is the Atonement.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"067#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I have emphasized that the miracle, or the expression of Atonement, is always a sign of respect <i>from</i> the worthy <i>to</i> the worthy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The recognition of this worth is re-established by the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is obvious, then, that when you are afraid, you have placed yourself in a position where you need Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have done something loveless, having chosen without love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is precisely the situation for which the Atonement was offered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The need for the remedy inspired its establishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>As long as you recognize only the need for the remedy, you will remain fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>However, as soon as you accept the remedy, you have abolished the fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>This is how true healing occurs.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"067#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone experiences fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it would take very little right thinking to realize why fear occurs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Few appreciate the real power of the mind, and no one remains fully aware of it all the time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>However, if you hope to spare yourself from fear there are some things you must realize, and realize fully.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The mind is very powerful, and never loses its creative force.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It never sleeps.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Every instant it is creating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is hard to recognize that thought and belief combine into a power surge that can literally move mountains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It appears at first glance that to believe such power about yourself is arrogant, but that is not the real reason you do not believe it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You prefer to believe that your thoughts cannot exert real influence because you are actually afraid of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>This may allay awareness of the guilt, but at the cost of perceiving the mind as impotent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>If you believe that what you think is ineffectual you may cease to be afraid of it, but you are hardly likely to respect it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>There <i>are</i> no idle thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"067#9:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>All thinking produces form at some level.</span></p></div>
