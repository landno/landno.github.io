class=\"snr\">3</span>But herein lies the split.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the mind that judges perceives itself as separate from the mind being judged, believing that by punishing another, it will escape punishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>All this is but the delusional attempt of the mind to deny itself, and escape the penalty of denial.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is not an attempt to relinquish denial, but to hold on to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For it is guilt that has obscured the Father to you, and it is guilt that has driven you insane.</span></p></div> <div

Son was the beginning of the separation, as the acceptance of the Atonement is its end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world you see is the delusional system of those made mad by guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Look carefully at this world, and you will realize that this is so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For this world is the symbol of punishment, and all the laws that seem to govern it are the laws of death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Children are born into it through pain and in pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Their growth is attended by suffering, and they learn of sorrow and separation and death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Their minds seem to be trapped in their brain, and its powers to decline if their bodies are hurt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They seem to love, yet they desert and are deserted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>They appear to lose what they love, perhaps the most insane belief of all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>And their bodies wither and gasp and are laid in the ground, and are no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#2:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Not one of them but has thought that God is cruel.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"164#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If this were the real world, God <i>would</i> be cruel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For no Father could subject His children to this as the price of salvation and <i>be</i> loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span><i>Love does not kill to save.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If it did, attack would be salvation, and this is the ego’s interpretation, not God’s.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Only the world of guilt could demand this, for only the guilty could conceive of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Adam’s “sin” could have touched no one, had he not believed it was the Father Who drove him out of Paradise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For in that belief the knowledge of the Father was lost, since only those who do not understand Him could believe it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"164#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This world <i>is</i> a picture of the crucifixion of God’s Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And until you realize that God’s Son cannot be crucified, this is the world you will see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you will not realize this until you accept the eternal fact that God’s Son is not guilty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He deserves only love because he has given only love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He cannot be condemned because he has never condemned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"164#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The Atonement is the final lesson he need learn, for it teaches him that, never having sinned, he has no need of salvation.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"If you did not feel guilty you could not attack, for condemnation is the root of attack.
