data-sentence-id=\"055#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you offer a miracle to any of my brothers, you do it to <i>yourself</i> and me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The reason you come before me is that I do not need miracles for my own Atonement, but I stand at the end in case you fail temporarily.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>My part in the Atonement is the cancelling out of all errors that you could not otherwise correct.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When you have been restored to the recognition of your original state, you naturally become part of the Atonement yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As you share my unwillingness to accept error in yourself and others, you must join the great crusade to correct it; listen to my voice, learn to undo error and act to correct it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The power to work miracles belongs to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I will provide the opportunities to do them, but you must be ready and willing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Doing them will bring conviction in the ability, because conviction comes through accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The ability is the potential, the achievement is its expression, and the Atonement, which is the natural profession of the children of God, is the purpose.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"055#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>“Heaven and earth shall pass away” means that they will not continue to exist as separate states.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>My word, which is the resurrection and the life, shall not pass away because life is eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are the work of God, and His work is wholly lovable and wholly loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is how a man must think of himself in his heart, because this is what he is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"055#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The forgiven are the means of the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Being filled with spirit, they forgive in return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Those who are released must join in releasing their brothers, for this is the plan of the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Miracles are the way in which minds that serve the Holy Spirit unite with me for the salvation or release of all of God’s creations.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"055#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I am the only one who can perform miracles indiscriminately, because I am the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You have a role in the Atonement which I will dictate to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Ask me which miracles you should perform.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This spares you needless effort, because you will be acting under direct communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The impersonal nature of the miracle is an essential ingredient, because it enables me to direct its application, and under my guidance miracles lead to the highly personal experience of revelation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A guide does not control but he does direct, leaving it up to you to follow.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>“Lead us not into temptation” means “Recognize your errors and choose to abandon them by following my guidance.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"055#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Error cannot really threaten truth, which can always withstand it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only the error is actually vulnerable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are free to establish your kingdom where you see fit, but the right choice is inevitable if you remember this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Spirit is in a state of grace forever.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your reality is only spirit.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Therefore you are in a state of grace forever.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Atonement undoes all errors in this respect, and thus uproots the source of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Whenever you experience God’s reassurances as threat, it is always because you are defending misplaced or misdirected loyalty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>When you project this to others you imprison them, but only to the extent to which you reinforce errors they have already made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This makes them vulnerable to the distortions of others, since their own perception of themselves is distorted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>The miracle worker can only bless them, and this undoes their distortions and frees them from prison.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"055#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You respond to what you perceive, and as you perceive so shall you behave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Golden Rule asks you to do unto others as you would have them do unto you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This means that the perception of both must be accurate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Golden Rule is the rule for appropriate behavior.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You cannot behave appropriately unless you perceive correctly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Since you and your neighbor are equal members of one family, as you perceive both so you will do to both.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You should look out from the perception of your own holiness to the holiness of others.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"055#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Miracles arise from a mind that is ready for them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>By being united this mind goes out to everyone, even without the awareness of the miracle worker himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The impersonal nature of miracles is because the Atonement itself is one, uniting all creations with their Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As an expression of what you truly are, the miracle places the mind in a state of grace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The mind then naturally welcomes the Host within and the stranger without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>When you bring in the stranger, he becomes your brother.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"055#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That the miracle may have effects on your brothers that you may not recognize is not your concern.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The miracle will always bless <i>you</i>.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Miracles you are not asked to perform have not lost their value.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are still expressions of your own state of grace, but the action aspect of the miracle should be controlled by me because of my complete awareness of the whole plan.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The impersonal nature of miracle-mindedness ensures your grace, but only I am in a position to know where they can be bestowed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"055#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Miracles are selective only in the sense that they are directed towards those who can use them for themselves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Since this makes it inevitable that they will extend them to others, a strong chain of Atonement is welded.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>However, this selectivity takes no account of the magnitude of the miracle itself, because the concept of size exists on a plane that is itself unreal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"055#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Since the miracle aims at restoring the awareness of reality, it would not be useful if it were bound by laws that govern the error it aims to correct.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"I am in charge of the process of Atonement, which I undertook to begin.
