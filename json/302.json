<span data-sentence-id=\"302#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The one remaining problem that you have is that you see an interval between the time when you forgive, and will receive the benefits of trusting in your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This but reflects the little you would keep between you and your brother, that you and he might be a little separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For time and space are one illusion, which takes different forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If it has been projected beyond your mind you think of it as time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The nearer it is brought to where it is, the more you think of it in terms of space.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"302#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a distance you would keep apart from your brother, and this space you perceive as time because you still believe you are external to him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This makes trust impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And you cannot believe that trust would settle every problem now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus do you think it safer to remain a little careful and a little watchful of interests perceived as separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>From this perception you cannot conceive of gaining what forgiveness offers <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The interval you think lies in between the giving and receiving of the gift seems to be one in which you sacrifice and suffer loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You see eventual salvation, not immediate results.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"302#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation <i>is</i> immediate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Unless you so perceive it, you will be afraid of it, believing that the risk of loss is great between the time its purpose is made yours and its effects will come to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In this form is the error still obscured that is the source of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Salvation <i>would</i> wipe out the space you see between you still, and let you instantly become as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And it is here you fear the loss would lie.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Do not project this fear to time, for time is not the enemy that you perceive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Time is as neutral as the body is, except in terms of what you see it for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If you would keep a little space between you and your brother still, you then would want a little time in which forgiveness is withheld a little while.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And this but makes the interval between the time in which forgiveness is withheld from you and given seem dangerous, with terror justified.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"302#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet space between you and your brother is apparent only in the present, <i>now,</i> and cannot be perceived in future time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No more can it be overlooked except within the present.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Future loss is not your fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But present joining is your dread.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who can feel desolation except now?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A future cause as yet has no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And therefore must it be that if you fear, there is a present cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And it is <i>this</i> that needs correction, not a future state.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"302#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The plans you make for safety all are laid within the future, where you cannot plan.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No purpose has been given it as yet, and what will happen has as yet no cause.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who can predict effects without a cause?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And who could fear effects unless he thought they had been caused, and judged disastrous <i>now?</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Belief in sin arouses fear, and like its cause, is looking forward, looking back, but overlooking what is here and now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet only here and now its cause must be, if its effects already have been judged as fearful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And in overlooking this, is it protected and kept separate from healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>For a miracle is <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It stands already here, in present grace, within the only interval of time that sin and fear have overlooked, but which is all there is to time.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"302#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The working out of all correction takes no time at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet the acceptance of the working out can seem to take forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The change of purpose the Holy Spirit brought to your relationship has in it all effects that you will see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They can be looked at <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Why wait till they unfold in time and fear they may not come, although already there?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You have been told that everything brings good that comes from God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And yet it seems as if this is not so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Good in disaster’s form is difficult to credit in advance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nor is there really sense in this idea.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"302#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Why should the good appear in evil’s form?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And is it not deception if it does?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Its cause is here, if it appears at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Why are not its effects apparent, then?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Why in the future?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you seek to be content with sighing, and with “reasoning” you do not understand it now, but will some day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And then its meaning will be clear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is not reason, for it is unjust, and clearly hints at punishment until the time of liberation is at hand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Given a change of purpose for the good, there is no reason for an interval in which disaster strikes, to be perceived as “good” some day but now in form of pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This is a sacrifice of <i>now,</i> which could not be the cost the Holy Spirit asks for what He gave without a cost at all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"302#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet this illusion has a cause which, though untrue, must be already in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And this illusion is but one effect that it engenders, and one form in which its outcome is perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This interval in time, when retribution is perceived to be the form in which the “good” appears, is but one aspect of the little space that lies between you, unforgiven still.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"302#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be not content with future happiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has no meaning, and is not your just reward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For you have cause for freedom <i>now.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What profits freedom in a prisoner’s form?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Why should deliverance be disguised as death?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Delay is senseless, and the “reasoning” that would maintain effects of present cause must be delayed until a future time, is merely a denial of the fact that consequence and cause must come as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Look not to time, but to the little space between you still, to be delivered from.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And do not let it be disguised as time, and so preserved because its form is changed and what it is cannot be recognized.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The Holy Spirit’s purpose now is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"302#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Should not His happiness be yours as well?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The one remaining problem that you
