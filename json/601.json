data-sentence-id=\"601#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God does not know of learning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet His Will extends to what He does not understand, in that He wills the happiness His Son inherited of Him be undisturbed; eternal and forever gaining scope, eternally expanding in the joy of full creation, and eternally open and wholly limitless in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And thus His Will provides the means to guarantee that it is done.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God sees no contradictions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet His Son believes he sees them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Thus he has a need for One Who can correct his erring sight, and give him vision that will lead him back to where perception ceases.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God does not perceive at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet it is He Who gives the means by which perception is made true and beautiful enough to let the light of Heaven shine upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is He Who answers what His Son would contradict, and keeps his sinlessness forever safe.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These are the lessons God would have you learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>His Will reflects them all, and they reflect His loving kindness to the Son He loves.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Each lesson has a central thought, the same in all of them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The form alone is changed, with different circumstances and events; with different characters and different themes, apparent but not real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>They are the same in fundamental content.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"601#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Forgive, and you will see this differently.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Certain it is that all distress does not appear to be but unforgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet that is the content underneath the form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is this sameness which makes learning sure, because the lesson is so simple that it cannot be rejected in the end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one can hide forever from a truth so very obvious that it appears in countless forms, and yet is recognized as easily in all of them, if one but wants to see the simple lesson there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#5\"><p class=\"p-prayer\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgive, and you will see this differently.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"601#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>These are the words the Holy Spirit speaks in all your tribulations, all your pain, all suffering regardless of its form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These are the words with which temptation ends, and guilt, abandoned, is revered no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>These are the words which end the dream of sin, and rid the mind of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>These are the words by which salvation comes to all the world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Shall we not learn to say these words when we are tempted to believe that pain is real, and death becomes our choice instead of life?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Shall we not learn to say these words when we have understood their power to release all minds from bondage?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These are words which give you power over all events that seem to have been given power over you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You see them rightly when you hold these words in full awareness, and do not forget these words apply to everything you see or any brother looks upon amiss.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How can you tell when you are seeing wrong, or someone else is failing to perceive the lesson he should learn?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Does pain seem real in the perception?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If it does, be sure the lesson is not learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And there remains an unforgiveness hiding in the mind that sees the pain through eyes the mind directs.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God would not have you suffer thus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He would help you forgive yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Son does not remember who he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And God would have him not forget His Love, and all the gifts His Love brings with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Would you now renounce your own salvation?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Would you fail to learn the simple lessons Heaven’s Teacher sets before you, that all pain may disappear and God may be remembered by His Son?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All things are lessons God would have you learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He would not leave an unforgiving thought without correction, nor one thorn or nail to hurt His holy Son in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He would ensure his holy rest remain untroubled and serene, without a care, in an eternal home which cares for him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And He would have all tears be wiped away, with none remaining yet unshed, and none but waiting their appointed time to fall.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For God has willed that laughter should replace each one, and that His Son be free again.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will attempt today to overcome a thousand seeming obstacles to peace in just one day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let mercy come to you more quickly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Do not try to hold it off another day, another minute or another instant.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Time was made for this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Use it today for what its purpose is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Morning and night, devote what time you can to serve its proper aim, and do not let the time be less than meets your deepest need.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Give all you can, and give a little more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For now we would arise in haste and go unto our Father’s house.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We have been gone too long, and we would linger here no more.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And as we practice, let us think about all things we saved to settle by ourselves, and kept apart from healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Let us give them all to Him Who knows the way to look upon them so that they will disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Truth is His message; truth His teaching is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>His are the lessons God would have us learn.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Each hour, spend a little time today, and in the days to come, in practicing the lesson in forgiveness in the form established for the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And try to give it application to the happenings the hour brought, so that the next one is free of the one before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The chains of time are easily unloosened in this way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let no one hour cast its shadow on the one that follows, and when that one goes, let everything that happened in its course go with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus will you remain unbound, in peace eternal in the world of time.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"601#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the lesson God would have you learn: There is a way to look on everything that lets it be to you another step to Him, and to salvation of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To all that speaks of terror, answer thus:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"601#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I will forgive, and this will disappear.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"601#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To every apprehension, every care and every form of suffering, repeat these selfsame words.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And then you hold the key that opens Heaven’s gate, and brings the Love of God the Father down to earth at last, to raise it up to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God will take this final step Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"601#13:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Do not deny the little steps He asks you take to Him.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"God does not know of learning.
