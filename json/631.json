data-sentence-id=\"631#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Words will mean little now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We use them but as guides on which we do not now depend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For now we seek direct experience of truth alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The lessons that remain are merely introductions to the times in which we leave the world of pain, and go to enter peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now we begin to reach the goal this course has set, and find the end toward which our practicing was always geared.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now we attempt to let the exercise be merely a beginning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For we wait in quiet expectation for our God and Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He has promised He will take the final step Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And we are sure His promises are kept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We have come far along the road, and now we wait for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We will continue spending time with Him each morning and at night, as long as makes us happy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>We will not consider time a matter of duration now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>We use as much as we will need for the result that we desire.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Nor will we forget our hourly remembrance in between, calling to God when we have need of Him as we are tempted to forget our goal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We will continue with a central thought for all the days to come, and we will use that thought to introduce our times of rest, and calm our minds at need.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet we will not content ourselves with simple practicing in the remaining holy instants which conclude the year that we have given God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We say some simple words of welcome, and expect our Father to reveal Himself, as He has promised.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We have called on Him, and He has promised that His Son will not remain unanswered when he calls His Name.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now do we come to Him with but His Word upon our minds and hearts, and wait for Him to take the step to us that He has told us, through His Voice, He would not fail to take when we invited Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He has not left His Son in all his madness, nor betrayed his trust in Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Has not His faithfulness earned Him the invitation that He seeks to make us happy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We will offer it, and it will be accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>So our times with Him will now be spent.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We say the words of invitation that His Voice suggests, and then we wait for Him to come to us.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now is the time of prophecy fulfilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now are all ancient promises upheld and fully kept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>No step remains for time to separate from its accomplishment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For now we cannot fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Sit silently and wait upon your Father.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He has willed to come to you when you have recognized it is your will He do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And you could have never come this far unless you saw, however dimly, that it is your will.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I am so close to you we cannot fail.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Father, we give these holy times to You, in gratitude to Him Who taught us how to leave the world of sorrow in exchange for its replacement, given us by You.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We look not backward now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We look ahead, and fix our eyes upon the journey’s end.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Accept these little gifts of thanks from us, as through Christ’s vision we behold a world beyond the one we made, and take that world to be the full replacement of our own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And now we wait in silence, unafraid and certain of Your coming.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We have sought to find our way by following the Guide You sent to us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We did not know the way, but You did not forget us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And we know that You will not forget us now.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We ask but that Your ancient promises be kept which are Your Will to keep.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We will with You in asking this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Father and the Son, Whose holy Will created all that is, can fail in nothing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In this certainty, we undertake these last few steps to You, and rest in confidence upon Your Love, which will not fail the Son who calls to You.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>And so we start upon the final part of this one holy year, which we have spent together in the search for truth and God, Who is its one Creator.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We have found the way He chose for us, and made the choice to follow it as He would have us go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Hand has held us up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>His Thoughts have lit the darkness of our minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His Love has called to us unceasingly since time began.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We had a wish that God would fail to have the Son whom He created for Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>We wanted God to change Himself, and be what we would make of Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And we believed that our insane desires were the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now we are glad that this is all undone, and we no longer think illusions true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The memory of God is shimmering across the wide horizons of our minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>A moment more, and it will rise again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>A moment more, and we who are God’s Sons are safely home, where He would have us be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now is the need for practice almost done.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For in this final section, we will come to understand that we need only call to God, and all temptations disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Instead of words, we need but feel His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Instead of prayers, we need but call His Name.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Instead of judging, we need but be still and let all things be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>We will accept the way God’s plan will end, as we received the way it started.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Now it is complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This year has brought us to eternity.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"631#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>One further use for words we still retain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From time to time, instructions on a theme of special relevance will intersperse our daily lessons and the periods of wordless, deep experience which should come afterwards.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>These special thoughts should be reviewed each day, each one of them to be continued till the next is given you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They should be slowly read and thought about a little while, preceding one of the holy and blessed instants in the day.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"631#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We give the first of these instructions now.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Words will
