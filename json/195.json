data-sentence-id=\"195#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is impossible to use one relationship at the expense of another and not to suffer guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And it is equally impossible to condemn part of a relationship and find peace within it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Under the Holy Spirit’s teaching all relationships are seen as total commitments, yet they do not conflict with one another in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perfect faith in each one, for its ability to satisfy you completely, arises only from perfect faith in yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this you cannot have while guilt remains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And there will be guilt as long as you accept the possibility, and cherish it, that you can make a brother into what he is not, because you would have him so.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"195#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You have so little faith in yourself because you are unwilling to accept the fact that perfect love is in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so you seek without for what you cannot find without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I offer you my perfect faith in you, in place of all your doubts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But forget not that my faith must be as perfect in all your brothers as it is in you, or it would be a limited gift to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In the holy instant we share our faith in God’s Son because we recognize, together, that he is wholly worthy of it, and in our appreciation of his worth we cannot doubt his holiness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And so we love him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"195#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All separation vanishes as holiness is shared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For holiness is power, and by sharing it, it gains in strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you seek for satisfaction in gratifying your needs as you perceive them, you must believe that strength comes from another, and what you gain he loses.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Someone must always lose if you perceive yourself as weak.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet there is another interpretation of relationships that transcends the concept of loss of power completely.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"195#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You do not find it difficult to believe that when another calls on God for love, your call remains as strong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nor do you think that when God answers him, your hope of answer is diminished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>On the contrary, you are more inclined to regard his success as witness to the possibility of yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That is because you recognize, however dimly, that God is an idea, and so your faith in Him is strengthened by sharing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you find difficult to accept is the fact that, like your Father, <i>you</i> are an idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And like Him, you can give yourself completely, wholly without loss and only with gain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Herein lies peace, for here there <i>is</i> no conflict.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"195#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the world of scarcity, love has no meaning and peace is impossible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For gain and loss are both accepted, and so no one is aware that perfect love is in him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In the holy instant you recognize the idea of love in you, and unite this idea with the Mind that thought it, and could not relinquish it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By holding it within itself, there <i>is</i> no loss.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The holy instant thus becomes a lesson in how to hold all of your brothers in your mind, experiencing not loss but completion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>From this it follows you can only give.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And this <i>is</i> love, for this alone is natural under the laws of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>In the holy instant the laws of God prevail, and only they have meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The laws of this world cease to hold any meaning at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>When the Son of God accepts the laws of God as what he gladly wills, it is impossible that he be bound, or limited in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>In that instant he is as free as God would have him be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#5:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>For the instant he refuses to be bound, he is not bound.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"195#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the holy instant nothing happens that has not always been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only the veil that has been drawn across reality is lifted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nothing has changed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet the awareness of changelessness comes swiftly as the veil of time is pushed aside.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No one who has not yet experienced the lifting of the veil, and felt himself drawn irresistibly into the light behind it, can have faith in love without fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet the Holy Spirit gives you this faith, because He offered it to me and I accepted it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Fear not the holy instant will be denied you, for I denied it not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And through me the Holy Spirit gives it unto you, as you will give it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let no need you perceive obscure your need of this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For in the holy instant you will recognize the only need the Sons of God share equally, and by this recognition you will join with me in offering what is needed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"195#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is through <i>us</i> that peace will come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Join me in the idea of peace, for in ideas minds can communicate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you would give yourself as your Father gives His Self, you will learn to understand Selfhood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And therein is love’s meaning understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But remember that understanding is of the mind, and only of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Knowledge is therefore of the mind, and its conditions are in the mind with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>If you were not an idea, and nothing but an idea, you could not be in full communication with all that ever was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet as long as you prefer to be something else, or would attempt to be nothing else and something else together, you will not remember the language of communication, which you know perfectly.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"195#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In the holy instant God is remembered, and the language of communication with all your brothers is remembered with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For communication is remembered together, as is truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no exclusion in the holy instant because the past is gone, and with it goes the whole basis for exclusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Without its source exclusion vanishes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And this permits your Source, and that of all your brothers, to replace it in your awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God and the power of God will take Their rightful place in you, and you will experience the full communication of ideas with ideas.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"195#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Through your ability to do this you will learn what you must be, for you will begin to understand what your Creator is, and what His creation is along with Him.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is impossible to use one relationship at the expense of another and not to suffer guilt.
