data-sentence-id=\"224#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is nothing outside you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>That is what you must ultimately learn, for it is the realization that the Kingdom of Heaven is restored to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For God created only this, and He did not depart from it nor leave it separate from Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Kingdom of Heaven is the dwelling place of the Son of God, who left not his Father and dwells not apart from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Heaven is not a place nor a condition.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is merely an awareness of perfect Oneness, and the knowledge that there is nothing else; nothing outside this Oneness, and nothing else within.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What could God give but knowledge of Himself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What else is there to give?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The belief that you could give and get something else, something outside yourself, has cost you the awareness of Heaven and of your Identity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you have done a stranger thing than you yet realize.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have displaced your guilt to your body from your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet a body cannot be guilty, for it can do nothing of itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You who think you hate your body deceive yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You hate your mind, for guilt has entered into it, and it would remain separate from your brother’s, which it cannot do.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Minds are joined; bodies are not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Only by assigning to the mind the properties of the body does separation seem to be possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And it is mind that seems to be fragmented and private and alone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Its guilt, which keeps it separate, is projected to the body, which suffers and dies because it is attacked to hold the separation in the mind, and let it not know its Identity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Mind cannot attack, but it can make fantasies and direct the body to act them out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet it is never what the body does that seems to satisfy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Unless the mind believes the body is actually acting out its fantasies, it will attack the body by increasing the projection of its guilt upon it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this, the mind is clearly delusional.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It cannot attack, but it maintains it can, and uses what it does to hurt the body to prove it can.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The mind cannot attack, but it can deceive itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And this is all it does when it believes it has attacked the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It can project its guilt, but it will not lose it through projection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And though it clearly can misperceive the function of the body, it cannot change its function from what the Holy Spirit establishes it to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The body was not made by love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Would you not have the instruments of separation reinterpreted as means for salvation, and used for purposes of love?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you not welcome and support the shift from fantasies of vengeance to release from them?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your perception of the body can clearly be sick, but project not this upon the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For your wish to make destructive what cannot destroy can have no real effect at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What God created is only what He would have it be, being His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You cannot make His Will destructive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You can make fantasies in which your will conflicts with His, but that is all.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is insane to use the body as the scapegoat for guilt, directing its attack and blaming it for what you wished it to do.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is impossible to act out fantasies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For it is still the fantasies you want, and they have nothing to do with what the body does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not dream of them, and they but make it a liability where it could be an asset.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For fantasies have made your body your “enemy”; weak, vulnerable and treacherous, worthy of the hate that you invest in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How has this served you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have identified with this thing you hate, the instrument of vengeance and the perceived source of your guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You have done this to a thing that has no meaning, proclaiming it to be the dwelling place of God’s Son, and turning it against him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the host of God that <i>you</i> have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And neither God nor His most holy Son can enter an abode that harbors hate, and where you have sown the seeds of vengeance, violence and death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This thing you made to serve your guilt stands between you and other minds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The minds <i>are</i> joined, but you do not identify with them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You see yourself locked in a separate prison, removed and unreachable, incapable of reaching out as being reached.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You hate this prison you have made, and would destroy it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But you would not escape from it, leaving it unharmed, without your guilt upon it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet only thus <i>can</i> you escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The home of vengeance is not yours; the place you set aside to house your hate is not a prison, but an illusion of yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body is a limit imposed on the universal communication that is an eternal property of mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But the communication is internal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Mind reaches to itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is <i>not</i> made up of different parts, which reach each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It does not go out.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Within itself it has no limits, and there is nothing outside it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It encompasses everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It encompasses you entirely; you within it and it within you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#8:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>There is nothing else, anywhere or ever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The body is outside you, and but seems to surround you, shutting you off from others and keeping you apart from them, and them from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There is no barrier between God and His Son, nor can His Son be separated from Himself except in illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is not his reality, though he believes it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet this could only be if God were wrong.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God would have had to create differently, and to have separated Himself from His Son to make this possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He would have had to create different things, and to establish different orders of reality, only some of which were love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet love must be forever like itself, changeless forever, and forever without alternative.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And so it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#9:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You cannot put a barrier around yourself, because God placed none between Himself and you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You can stretch out your hand and reach to Heaven.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You whose hand is joined with your brother’s have begun to reach beyond the body, but not outside yourself, to reach your shared Identity together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Could this be outside you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Where God is not?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is <i>He</i> a body, and did He create you as He is not, and where He cannot be?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You are surrounded only by Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What limits can there be on you whom He encompasses?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Everyone has experienced what he would call a sense of being transported beyond himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This feeling of liberation far exceeds the dream of freedom sometimes hoped for in special relationships.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a sense of actual escape from limitations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you will consider what this “transportation” really entails, you will realize that it is a sudden unawareness of the body, and a joining of yourself and something else in which your mind enlarges to encompass it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It becomes part of you, as you unite with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And both become whole, as neither is perceived as separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What really happens is that you have given up the illusion of a limited awareness, and lost your fear of union.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The love that instantly replaces it extends to what has freed you, and unites with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And while this lasts you are not uncertain of your Identity, and would not limit It.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>You have escaped from fear to peace, asking no questions of reality, but merely accepting it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#11:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>You have accepted this instead of the body, and have let yourself be one with something beyond it, simply by not letting your mind be limited by it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This can occur regardless of the physical distance that seems to be between you and what you join; of your respective positions in space; and of your differences in size and seeming quality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Time is not relevant; it can occur with something past, present or anticipated.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The “something” can be anything and anywhere; a sound, a sight, a thought, a memory, and even a general idea without specific reference.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet in every case, you join it without reservation because you love it, and would be with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And so you rush to meet it, letting your limits melt away, suspending all the “laws” your body obeys and gently setting them aside.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no violence at all in this escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The body is not attacked, but simply properly perceived.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It does not limit you, merely because you would not have it so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You are not really “lifted out” of it; it cannot contain you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You go where you would be, gaining, not losing, a sense of Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#13:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>In these instants of release from physical restrictions, you experience much of what happens in the holy instant; the lifting of the barriers of time and space, the sudden experience of peace and joy, and, above all, the lack of awareness of the body, and of the questioning whether or not all this is possible.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"224#14\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">14.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#14:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is possible because you want it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#14:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The sudden expansion of awareness that takes place with your desire for it is the irresistible appeal the holy instant holds.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It calls to you to be yourself, within its safe embrace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#14:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>There are the laws of limit lifted for you, to welcome you to openness of mind and freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#14:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Come to this place of refuge, where you can be yourself in peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#14:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Not through destruction, not through a breaking out, but merely by a quiet melting in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"224#14:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For peace will join you there, simply because you have been willing to let go the limits you have placed upon love, and joined it where it is and where it led you, in answer to its gentle call to be at peace.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"There is nothing outside you.
