data-sentence-id=\"089#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Healing is a thought by which two minds perceive their oneness and become glad.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This gladness calls to every part of the Sonship to rejoice with them, and lets God go out into them and through them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only the healed mind can experience revelation with lasting effect, because revelation is an experience of pure joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you do not choose to be wholly joyous, your mind cannot have what it does not choose to be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Remember that spirit knows no difference between <i>having</i> and <i>being.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The higher mind thinks according to the laws spirit obeys, and therefore honors only the laws of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>To spirit getting is meaningless and giving is all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Having everything, spirit holds everything by giving it, and thus creates as the Father created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>While this kind of thinking is totally alien to having things, even to the lower mind it is quite comprehensible in connection with ideas.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>If you share a physical possession, you do divide its ownership.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>If you share an idea, however, you do not lessen it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>All of it is still yours although all of it has been given away.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Further, if the one to whom you give it accepts it as his, he reinforces it in your mind and thus increases it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#1:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>If you can accept the concept that the world is one of ideas, the whole belief in the false association the ego makes between giving and losing is gone.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"089#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us start our process of reawakening with just a few simple concepts:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"089#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Thoughts increase by being given away.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The more who believe in them the stronger they become.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Everything is an idea.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How, then, can giving and losing be associated?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"089#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is the invitation to the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I have said already that I can reach up and bring the Holy Spirit down to you, but I can bring Him to you only at your own invitation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit is in your right mind, as He was in mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Bible says, “May the mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus,” and uses this as a blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the blessing of miracle-mindedness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It asks that you may think as I thought, joining with me in Christ thinking.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"089#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is the only part of the Holy Trinity that has a symbolic function.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He is referred to as the Healer, the Comforter and the Guide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He is also described as something “separate,” apart from the Father and from the Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>I myself said, “If I go I will send you another Comforter and he will abide with you.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>His symbolic function makes the Holy Spirit difficult to understand, because symbolism is open to different interpretations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>As a man and also one of God’s creations, my right thinking, which came from the Holy Spirit or the Universal Inspiration, taught me first and foremost that this Inspiration is for all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I could not have It myself without knowing this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The word “know” is proper in this context, because the Holy Spirit is so close to knowledge that He calls it forth; or better, allows it to come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I have spoken before of the higher or “true” perception, which is so near to truth that God Himself can flow across the little gap.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Knowledge is always ready to flow everywhere, but it cannot oppose.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#4:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Therefore you can obstruct it, although you can never lose it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"089#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit is the Christ Mind which is aware of the knowledge that lies beyond perception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He came into being with the separation as a protection, inspiring the Atonement principle at the same time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Before that there was no need for healing, for no one was comfortless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Voice of the Holy Spirit is the Call to Atonement, or the restoration of the integrity of the mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>When the Atonement is complete and the whole Sonship is healed there will be no Call to return.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But what God creates is eternal.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The Holy Spirit will remain with the Sons of God, to bless their creations and keep them in the light of joy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"089#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God honored even the miscreations of His children because they had made them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But He also blessed His children with a way of thinking that could raise their perceptions so high they could reach almost back to Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit is the Mind of the Atonement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He represents a state of mind close enough to One-mindedness that transfer to it is at last possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perception is not knowledge, but it can be transferred to knowledge, or cross over into it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It might even be more helpful here to use the literal meaning of transferred or “carried over,” since the last step is taken by God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"089#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit, the shared Inspiration of all the Sonship, induces a kind of perception in which many elements are like those in the Kingdom of Heaven itself:<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>First, its universality is perfectly clear, and no one who attains it could believe for one instant that sharing it involves anything but gain.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Second, it is incapable of attack and is therefore truly open.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This means that although it does not engender knowledge, it does not obstruct it in any way.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Finally, it points the way beyond the healing that it brings, and leads the mind beyond its own integration toward the paths of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"089#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is at this point that sufficient quantitative change occurs to produce a real qualitative shift.</span></p></div>
