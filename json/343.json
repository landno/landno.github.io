class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How simple is salvation!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All it says is what was never true is not true now, and never will be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The impossible has not occurred, and can have no effects.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And that is all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Can this be hard to learn by anyone who wants it to be true?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Only unwillingness to learn it could make such an easy lesson difficult.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>How hard is it to see that what is false can not be true, and what is true can not be false?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You can no longer say that you perceive no differences in false and true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You have been told exactly how to tell one from the other, and just what to do if you become confused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Why, then, do you persist in learning not such simple things?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a reason.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But confuse it not with difficulty in the simple things salvation asks you learn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It teaches but the very obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It merely goes from one apparent lesson to the next, in easy steps that lead you gently from one to another, with no strain at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This cannot be confusing, yet you are confused.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For somehow you believe that what is totally confused is easier to learn and understand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What you have taught yourself is such a giant learning feat it is indeed incredible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But you accomplished it because you wanted to, and did not pause in diligence to judge it hard to learn or too complex to grasp.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No one who understands what you have learned, how carefully you learned it, and the pains to which you went to practice and repeat the lessons endlessly, in every form you could conceive of them, could ever doubt the power of your learning skill.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no greater power in the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The world was made by it, and even now depends on nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The lessons you have taught yourself have been so overlearned and fixed they rise like heavy curtains to obscure the simple and the obvious.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Say not you cannot learn them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For your power to learn is strong enough to teach you that your will is not your own, your thoughts do not belong to you, and even you are someone else.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who could maintain that lessons such as these are easy?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet you have learned more than this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have continued, taking every step, however difficult, without complaint, until a world was built that suited you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And every lesson that makes up the world arises from the first accomplishment of learning; an enormity so great the Holy Spirit’s Voice seems small and still before its magnitude.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The world began with one strange lesson, powerful enough to render God forgotten, and His Son an alien to himself, in exile from the home where God Himself established him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You who have taught yourself the Son of God is guilty, say not that you cannot learn the simple things salvation teaches you!</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Learning is an ability you made and gave yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It was not made to do the Will of God, but to uphold a wish that it could be opposed, and that a will apart from it was yet more real than it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this has learning sought to demonstrate, and you have learned what it was made to teach.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now does your ancient overlearning stand implacable before the Voice of truth, and teach you that Its lessons are not true; too hard to learn, too difficult to see, and too opposed to what is really true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you will learn them, for their learning is the only purpose for your learning skill the Holy Spirit sees in all the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>His simple lessons in forgiveness have a power mightier than yours, because they call from God and from your Self to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Is this a little Voice, so small and still It cannot rise above the senseless noise of sounds that have no meaning?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>God willed not His Son forget Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And the power of His Will is in the Voice that speaks for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Which lesson will you learn?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What outcome is inevitable, sure as God, and far beyond all doubt and question?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can it be your little learning, strange in outcome and incredible in difficulty will withstand the simple lessons being taught to you in every moment of each day, since time began and learning had been made?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The lessons to be learned are only two.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Each has its outcome in a different world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And each world follows surely from its source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The certain outcome of the lesson that God’s Son is guilty is the world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is a world of terror and despair.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Nor is there hope of happiness in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no plan for safety you can make that ever will succeed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There is no joy that you can seek for here and hope to find.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Yet this is not the only outcome which your learning can produce.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>However much you may have overlearned your chosen task, the lesson that reflects the Love of God is stronger still.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>And you will learn God’s Son is innocent, and see another world.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The outcome of the lesson that God’s Son is guiltless is a world in which there is no fear, and everything is lit with hope and sparkles with a gentle friendliness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Nothing but calls to you in soft appeal to be your friend, and let it join with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And never does a call remain unheard, misunderstood, nor left unanswered in the selfsame tongue in which the call was made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will understand it was this call that everyone and everything within the world has always made, but you had not perceived it as it was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And now you see you were mistaken.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You had been deceived by forms the call was hidden in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And so you did not hear it, and had lost a friend who always wanted to be part of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The soft eternal calling of each part of God’s creation to the whole is heard throughout the world this second lesson brings.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no living thing that does not share the universal Will that it be whole, and that you do not leave its call unheard.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Without your answer is it left to die, as it is saved from death when you have heard its calling as the ancient call to life, and understood that it is but your own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Christ in you remembers God with all the certainty with which He knows His Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But only if His Son is innocent can He be Love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For God were fear indeed if he whom He created innocent could be a slave to guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God’s perfect Son remembers his creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>But in guilt he has forgotten what he really is.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The fear of God results as surely from the lesson that His Son is guilty as God’s Love must be remembered when he learns his innocence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For hate must father fear, and look upon its father as itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How wrong are you who fail to hear the call that echoes past each seeming call to death, that sings behind each murderous attack and pleads that love restore the dying world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do not understand Who calls to you beyond each form of hate; each call to war.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet you will recognize Him as you give Him answer in the language that He calls.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He will appear when you have answered Him, and you will know in Him that God is Love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What is temptation but a wish to make the wrong decision on what you would learn, and have an outcome that you do not want?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is the recognition that it is a state of mind unwanted that becomes the means whereby the choice is reassessed; another outcome seen to be preferred.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You are deceived if you believe you want disaster and disunity and pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Hear not the call for this within yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But listen, rather, to the deeper call beyond it that appeals for peace and joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And all the world will give you joy and peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For as you hear, you answer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>And behold!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your answer is the proof of what you learned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#11:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Its outcome is the world you look upon.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let us be still an instant, and forget all things we ever learned, all thoughts we had, and every preconception that we hold of what things mean and what their purpose is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us remember not our own ideas of what the world is for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>We do not know.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let every image held of everyone be loosened from our minds and swept away.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"343#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Be innocent of judgment, unaware of any thoughts of evil or of good that ever crossed your mind of anyone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now do you know him not.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But you are free to learn of him, and learn of him anew.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now is he born again to you, and you are born again to him, without the past that sentenced him to die, and you with him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"343#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Now is he free to live as you are free, because an ancient learning passed away, and left a place for truth to be reborn.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"How simple is
