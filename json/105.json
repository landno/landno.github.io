<span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>We said before that the Holy Spirit is evaluative, and must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He sorts out the true from the false in your mind, and teaches you to judge every thought you allow to enter it in the light of what God put there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Whatever is in accord with this light He retains, to strengthen the Kingdom in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What is partly in accord with it He accepts and purifies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But what is out of accord entirely He rejects by judging against.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is how He keeps the Kingdom perfectly consistent and perfectly unified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Remember, however, that what the Holy Spirit rejects the ego accepts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is because they are in fundamental disagreement about everything, being in fundamental disagreement about what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The ego’s beliefs on this crucial issue vary, and that is why it promotes different moods.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The Holy Spirit never varies on this point, and so the one mood He engenders is joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>He protects it by rejecting everything that does not foster joy, and so He alone can keep you wholly joyous.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"105#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit does not teach you to judge others, because He does not want you to teach error and learn it yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He would hardly be consistent if He allowed you to strengthen what you must learn to avoid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In the mind of the thinker, then, He <i>is</i> judgmental, but only in order to unify the mind so it can perceive without judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This enables the mind to teach without judgment, and therefore to learn to <i>be</i> without judgment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The undoing is necessary only in your mind, so that you will not project, instead of extend.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God Himself has established what you can extend with perfect safety.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Therefore, the Holy Spirit’s third lesson is:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"105#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Be vigilant only for God and His Kingdom.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"105#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is a major step toward fundamental change.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet it still has an aspect of thought reversal, since it implies that there is something you must be vigilant <i>against.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It has advanced far from the first lesson, which is merely the beginning of the thought reversal, and also from the second, which is essentially the identification of what is more desirable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This step, which follows from the second as the second follows from the first, emphasizes the dichotomy between the desirable and the undesirable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It therefore makes the ultimate choice inevitable.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"105#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>While the first step seems to increase conflict and the second may still entail conflict to some extent, this step calls for consistent vigilance against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>I have already told you that you can be as vigilant against the ego as for it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This lesson teaches not only that you can be, but that you <i>must</i> be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It does not concern itself with order of difficulty, but with clear-cut priority for vigilance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This lesson is unequivocal in that it teaches there must be no exceptions, although it does not deny that the temptation to make exceptions will occur.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Here, then, your consistency is called on despite chaos.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Yet chaos and consistency cannot coexist for long, since they are mutually exclusive.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>As long as you must be vigilant against anything, however, you are not recognizing this mutual exclusiveness, and still believe that you can choose either one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>By teaching <i>what</i> to choose, the Holy Spirit will ultimately teach you that you need not choose at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#4:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This will finally liberate your mind from choice, and direct it towards creation within the Kingdom.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"105#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Choosing through the Holy Spirit will lead you to the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You create by your true being, but what you are you must learn to remember.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The way to remember it is inherent in the third step, which brings together the lessons implied in the others, and goes beyond them towards real integration.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>If you allow yourself to have in your mind only what God put there, you are acknowledging your mind as God created it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Therefore, you are accepting it as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Since it is whole, you are teaching peace <i>because</i> you believe in it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The final step will still be taken for you by God, but by the third step the Holy Spirit has prepared you for God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is getting you ready for the translation of <i>having</i> into <i>being</i> by the very nature of the steps you must take with Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"105#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You learn first that <i>having</i> rests on giving, and not on getting.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Next you learn that you learn what you teach, and that you want to learn peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is the condition for identifying with the Kingdom, since it is the condition <i>of</i> the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have believed that you are without the Kingdom, and have therefore excluded yourself from it in your belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is therefore essential to teach you that you must be included, and that the belief that you are not is the only thing that you must exclude.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"105#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The third step is thus one of protection for your mind, allowing you to identify only with the center, where God placed the altar to Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Altars are beliefs, but God and His creations are beyond belief because they are beyond question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Voice for God speaks only for belief beyond question, which is the preparation for <i>being</i> without question.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As long as belief in God and His Kingdom is assailed by any doubts in your mind, His perfect accomplishment is not apparent to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This is why you must be vigilant on God’s behalf.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The ego speaks against His creation, and therefore engenders doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You cannot go beyond belief until you believe fully.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"105#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To teach the whole Sonship without exception demonstrates that you perceive its wholeness, and have learned that it is one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Now you must be vigilant to hold its oneness in your mind because, if you let doubt enter, you will lose awareness of its wholeness and will be unable to teach it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The wholeness of the Kingdom does not depend on your perception, but your awareness of its wholeness does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is only your awareness that needs protection, since being cannot be assailed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet a real sense of being cannot be yours while you are doubtful of what you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is why vigilance is essential.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Doubts about being must not enter your mind, or you cannot know what you are with certainty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Certainty is of God for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Vigilance is not necessary for truth, but it is necessary against illusions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"105#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Truth is without illusions and therefore within the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Everything outside the Kingdom is illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you threw truth away you saw yourself as if you were without it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>By making another kingdom that you valued, you did not keep <i>only</i> the Kingdom of God in your mind, and thus placed part of your mind outside it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What you made has imprisoned your will, and given you a sick mind that must be healed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your vigilance against this sickness is the way to heal it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Once your mind is healed it radiates health, and thereby teaches healing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This establishes you as a teacher who teaches like me.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Vigilance was required of me as much as of you, and those who choose to teach the same thing must be in agreement about what they believe.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"105#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The third step, then, is a statement of what you want to believe, and entails a willingness to relinquish everything else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The Holy Spirit will enable you to take this step, if you follow Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your vigilance is the sign that you <i>want</i> Him to guide you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Vigilance does require effort, but only until you learn that effort itself is unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You have exerted great effort to preserve what you made because it was not true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Therefore, you must now turn your effort against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only this can cancel out the need for effort, and call upon the being which you both <i>have</i> and <i>are.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This recognition is wholly without effort since it is already true and needs no protection.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is in the perfect safety of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"105#10:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Therefore, inclusion is total and creation is without limit.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"We said before that the Holy Spirit is evaluative, and must be.
