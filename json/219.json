class=\"snr\">2</span>If you would but consider exactly what this entails, you would perceive at once how much at variance this is with the goal the Holy Spirit has given you, and would accomplish for you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To substitute is to choose between, renouncing one aspect of the Sonship in favor of the other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For this special purpose, one is judged more valuable and the other is replaced by him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The relationship in which the substitution occurred is thus fragmented, and its purpose split accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>To fragment is to exclude, and substitution is the strongest defense the ego has for separation.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The Holy Spirit never uses substitutes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Where the ego perceives one person as a replacement for another, the Holy Spirit sees them joined and indivisible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He does not judge between them, knowing they are one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Being united, they are one because they are the same.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Substitution is clearly a process in which they are perceived as different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>One would unite; the other separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Nothing can come between what God has joined and what the Holy Spirit sees as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But everything <i>seems</i> to come between the fragmented relationships the ego sponsors to destroy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The one emotion in which substitution is impossible is love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Fear involves substitution by definition, for it is love’s replacement.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fear is both a fragmented and fragmenting emotion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It seems to take many forms, and each one seems to require a different form of acting out for satisfaction.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>While this appears to introduce quite variable behavior, a far more serious effect lies in the fragmented perception from which the behavior stems.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No one is seen complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The body is emphasized, with special emphasis on certain parts, and used as the standard for comparison of acceptance or rejection for acting out a special form of fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who believe that God is fear made but one substitution.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It has taken many forms, because it was the substitution of illusion for truth; of fragmentation for wholeness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It has become so splintered and subdivided and divided again, over and over, that it is now almost impossible to perceive it once was one, and still is what it was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>That one error, which brought truth to illusion, infinity to time, and life to death, was all you ever made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Your whole world rests upon it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Everything you see reflects it, and every special relationship that you have ever made is part of it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You may be surprised to hear how very different is reality from what you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not realize the magnitude of that one error.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It was so vast and so completely incredible that from it a world of total unreality <i>had</i> to emerge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What else could come of it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its fragmented aspects are fearful enough, as you begin to look at them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But nothing you have seen begins to show you the enormity of the original error, which seemed to cast you out of Heaven, to shatter knowledge into meaningless bits of disunited perceptions, and to force you to make further substitutions.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>That was the first projection of error outward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The world arose to hide it, and became the screen on which it was projected and drawn between you and the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For truth extends inward, where the idea of loss is meaningless and only increase is conceivable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Do you really think it strange that a world in which everything is backwards and upside down arose from this projection of error?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It was inevitable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For truth brought to this could only remain within in quiet, and take no part in all the mad projection by which this world was made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Call it not sin but madness, for such it was and so it still remains.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Invest it not with guilt, for guilt implies it was accomplished in reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And above all, <i>be not afraid of it.</i></span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>When you seem to see some twisted form of the original error rising to frighten you, say only, “God is not fear, but Love,” and it will disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The truth will save you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It has not left you, to go out into the mad world and so depart from you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Inward is sanity; insanity is outside you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You but believe it is the other way; that truth is outside, and error and guilt within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Your little, senseless substitutions, touched with insanity and swirling lightly off on a mad course like feathers dancing insanely in the wind, have no substance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>They fuse and merge and separate, in shifting and totally meaningless patterns that need not be judged at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>To judge them individually is pointless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Their tiny differences in form are no real differences at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>None of them matters.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span><i>That</i> they have in common and nothing else.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>Yet what else is necessary to make them all the same?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Let them all go, dancing in the wind, dipping and turning till they disappear from sight, far, far outside of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And turn you to the stately calm within, where in holy stillness dwells the living God you never left, and Who never left you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Holy Spirit takes you gently by the hand, and retraces with you your mad journey outside yourself, leading you gently back to the truth and safety within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He brings all your insane projections and the wild substitutions that you have placed outside you to the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Thus He reverses the course of insanity and restores you to reason.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In your relationship with your brother, where He has taken charge of everything at your request, He has set the course inward to the truth you share.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In the mad world outside you nothing can be shared but only substituted, and sharing and substituting have nothing in common in reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Within yourself you love your brother with a perfect love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here is holy ground, in which no substitution can enter, and where only the truth in your brother can abide.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Here you are joined in God, as much together as you are with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The original error has not entered here, nor ever will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Here is the radiant truth, to which the Holy Spirit has committed your relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Let Him bring it here, where <i>you</i> would have it be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#9:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Give Him but a little faith in your brother, to help Him show you that no substitute you made for Heaven can keep you from it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In you there is no separation, and no substitute can keep you from your brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#10:2\"><span

there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And He would never accept something else instead of you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#10:5\"><span

which you stand together.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#10:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>God is with you, my brother.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"219#10:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Let us join in Him in peace and gratitude, and accept His gift as our most holy and perfect reality, which we share in Him.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"219#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span
