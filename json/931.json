class=\"acim-text song-2-sect-2\"> <div data-paragraph-id=\"931#1\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness-to-destroy has many forms, being a weapon of the world of form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Not all of them are obvious, and some are carefully concealed beneath what seems like charity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet all the forms that it may seem to take have but this single goal; their purpose is to separate and make what God created equal, different.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The difference is clear in several forms where the designed comparison cannot be missed, nor is it really meant to be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"931#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In this group, first, there are the forms in which a “better” person deigns to stoop to save a “baser” one from what he truly is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Forgiveness here rests on an attitude of gracious lordliness so far from love that arrogance could never be dislodged.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Who can forgive and yet despise?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And who can tell another he is steeped in sin, and yet perceive him as the Son of God?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who makes a slave to teach what freedom is?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>There is no union here, but only grief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>This is not really mercy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This is death.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"931#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Another form, still very like the first if it is understood, does not appear in quite such blatant arrogance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The one who would forgive the other does not claim to be the better.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Now he says instead that here is one whose sinfulness he shares, since both have been unworthy and deserve the retribution of the wrath of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This can appear to be a humble thought, and may indeed induce a rivalry in sinfulness and guilt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is not love for God’s creation and the holiness that is His gift forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Can His Son condemn himself and still remember Him?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"931#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here the goal is to separate from God the Son He loves, and keep him from his Source.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This goal is also sought by those who seek the role of martyr at another’s hand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Here must the aim be clearly seen, for this may pass as meekness and as charity instead of cruelty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Is it not kind to be accepting of another’s spite, and not respond except with silence and a gentle smile?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Behold, how good are you who bear with patience and with saintliness the anger and the hurt another gives, and do not show the bitter pain you feel.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"931#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness-to-destroy will often hide behind a cloak like this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It shows the face of suffering and pain, in silent proof of guilt and of the ravages of sin.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Such is the witness that it offers one who could be savior, not an enemy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But having been made enemy, he must accept the guilt and heavy-laid reproach that thus is put upon him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Is this love?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Or is it rather treachery to one who needs salvation from the pain of guilt?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What could the purpose be, except to keep the witnesses of guilt away from love?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"931#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Forgiveness-to-destroy can also take the form of bargaining and compromise.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>“I will forgive you if you meet my needs, for in your slavery is my release.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Say this to anyone and you are slave.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will seek to rid yourself of guilt in further bargains which can give no hope, but only greater pain and misery.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How fearful has forgiveness now become, and how distorted is the end it seeks.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Have mercy on yourself who bargains thus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God gives and does not ask for recompense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>There is no giving but to give like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>All else is mockery.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>For who would try to strike a bargain with the Son of God, and thank his Father for his holiness?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"931#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>What would you show your brother?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Would you try to reinforce his guilt and thus your own?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Forgiveness is the means for your escape.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>How pitiful it is to make of it the means for further slavery and pain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Within the world of opposites there is a way to use forgiveness for the goal of God, and find the peace He offers you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Take nothing else, or you have sought your death, and prayed for separation from your Self.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Christ is for all because He is in all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is His face forgiveness lets you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is His face in which you see your own.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"931#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All forms forgiveness takes that do not lead away from anger, condemnation and comparisons of every kind are death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For that is what their purposes have set.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Be not deceived by them, but lay them by as worthless in their tragic offerings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You do not want to stay in slavery.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You do not want to be afraid of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You want to see the sunlight and the glow of Heaven shining on the face of earth, redeemed from sin and in the Love of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>From here is prayer released, along with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"931#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your wings are free, and prayer will lift you up and bring you home where God would have you be.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Forgiveness-to-destroy has many forms, being a weapon of the world of form.
