class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a reawakening or a rebirth; a change of mind about the meaning of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is the acceptance of the Holy Spirit’s interpretation of the world’s purpose; the acceptance of the Atonement for oneself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is the end of dreams of misery, and the glad awareness of the Holy Spirit’s final dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the recognition of the gifts of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is the dream in which the body functions perfectly, having no function except communication.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>It is the lesson in which learning ends, for it is consummated and surpassed with this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It is the invitation to God to take His final step.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>It is the relinquishment of all other purposes, all other interests, all other wishes and all other concerns.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It is the single desire of the Son for the Father.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"843#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The resurrection is the denial of death, being the assertion of life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Thus is all the thinking of the world reversed entirely.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Life is now recognized as salvation, and pain and misery of any kind perceived as hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Love is no longer feared, but gladly welcomed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Idols have disappeared, and the remembrance of God shines unimpeded across the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Christ’s face is seen in every living thing, and nothing is held in darkness, apart from the light of forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There is no sorrow still upon the earth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The joy of Heaven has come upon it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"843#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Here the curriculum ends.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From here on, no directions are needed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Vision is wholly corrected and all mistakes undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Attack is meaningless and peace has come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The goal of the curriculum has been achieved.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thoughts turn to Heaven and away from hell.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>All longings are satisfied, for what remains unanswered or incomplete?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The last illusion spreads across the world, forgiving all things and replacing all attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The whole reversal is accomplished.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Nothing is left to contradict the Word of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>There is no opposition to the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>And now the truth can come at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#3:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>How quickly will it come as it is asked to enter and envelop such a world!</span></p></div> <div

deep anticipation, for the time of everlasting things is now at hand.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There is no death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Son of God is free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And in his freedom is the end of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>No hidden places now remain on earth to shelter sick illusions, dreams of fear and misperceptions of the universe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All things are seen in light, and in the light their purpose is transformed and understood.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And we, God’s children, rise up from the dust and look upon our perfect sinlessness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The song of Heaven sounds around the world, as it is lifted up and brought to truth.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"843#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now there are no distinctions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Differences have disappeared and Love looks on Itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>What further sight is needed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>What remains that vision could accomplish?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>We have seen the face of Christ, His sinlessness, His Love behind all forms, beyond all purposes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Holy are we because His Holiness has set us free indeed!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>And we accept His Holiness as ours; as it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>As God created us so will we be forever and forever, and we wish for nothing but His Will to be our own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Illusions of another will are lost, for unity of purpose has been found.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"843#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>These things await us all, but we are not prepared as yet to welcome them with joy.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As long as any mind remains possessed of evil dreams, the thought of hell is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>God’s teachers have the goal of wakening the minds of those asleep, and seeing there the vision of Christ’s face to take the place of what they dream.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The thought of murder is replaced with blessing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Judgment is laid by, and given Him Whose function judgment is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And in His Final Judgment is restored the truth about the holy Son of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>He is redeemed, for he has heard God’s Word and understood its meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>He is free because he let God’s Voice proclaim the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"843#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And all he sought before to crucify are resurrected with him, by his side, as he prepares with them to meet his God.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"Very simply, the
