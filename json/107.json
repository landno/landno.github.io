class=\"pnr\">1.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The creative power of God and His creations is limitless, but they are not in reciprocal relationship.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You communicate fully with God, as He does with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This is an ongoing process in which you share, and because you share it, you are inspired to create like God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet in creation you are not in a reciprocal relation to God, since He created you but you did not create Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>I have already told you that only in this respect your creative power differs from His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Even in this world there is a parallel.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Parents give birth to children, but children do not give birth to parents.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>They do, however, give birth to their children, and thus give birth as their parents do.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"107#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you created God and He created you, the Kingdom could not increase through its own creative thought.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Creation would therefore be limited, and you would not be co-creator with God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>As God’s creative Thought proceeds from Him to you, so must your creative thought proceed from you to your creations.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Only in this way can all creative power extend outward.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>God’s accomplishments are not yours, but yours are like His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He created the Sonship and you increase it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have the power to add to the Kingdom, though not to add to the Creator of the Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You claim this power when you become vigilant only for God and His Kingdom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>By accepting this power as yours you have learned to remember what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"107#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Your creations belong in you, as you belong in God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You are part of God, as your sons are part of His Sons.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To create is to love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Love extends outward simply because it cannot be contained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Being limitless it does not stop.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It creates forever, but not in time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>God’s creations have always been, because He has always been.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your creations have always been, because you can create only as God creates.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#3:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Eternity is yours, because He created you eternal.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"107#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The ego, on the other hand, always demands reciprocal rights, because it is competitive rather than loving.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is always willing to strike a bargain, but it cannot understand that to be like another means that no bargains are possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>To gain you must give, not bargain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>To bargain is to limit giving, and this is not God’s Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>To will with God is to create like Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>God does not limit His gifts in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You <i>are</i> His gifts, and so your gifts must be like His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Your gifts to the Kingdom must be like His gifts to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"107#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>I gave only love to the Kingdom because I believed that was what I was.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>What you believe you are determines your gifts, and if God created you by extending Himself as you, you can only extend yourself as He did.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Only joy increases forever, since joy and eternity are inseparable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>God extends outward beyond limits and beyond time, and you who are co-creator with Him extend His Kingdom forever and beyond limit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Eternity is the indelible stamp of creation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The eternal are in peace and joy forever.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"107#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To think like God is to share His certainty of what you are, and to create like Him is to share the perfect Love He shares with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To this the Holy Spirit leads you, that your joy may be complete because the Kingdom of God is whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have said that the last step in the reawakening of knowledge is taken by God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is true, but it is hard to explain in words because words are symbols, and nothing that is true need be explained.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>However, the Holy Spirit has the task of translating the useless into the useful, the meaningless into the meaningful, and the temporary into the timeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He can therefore tell you something about this last step.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"107#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>God does not take steps, because His accomplishments are not gradual.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>He does not teach, because His creations are changeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>He does nothing last, because He created first and for always.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It must be understood that the word “first” as applied to Him is not a time concept.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>He is first in the sense that He is the First in the Holy Trinity Itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>He is the Prime Creator, because He created His co-creators.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Because He did, time applies neither to Him nor to what He created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>The “last step” that God will take was therefore true in the beginning, is true now, and will be true forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>What is timeless is always there, because its being is eternally changeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>It does not change by increase, because it was forever created to increase.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>If you perceive it as not increasing you do not know what it is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>You also do not know Who created it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>God does not reveal this to you because it was never hidden.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:14\"><span class=\"snr\">14</span>His light was never obscured, because it is His Will to share it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"107#7:15\"><span class=\"snr\">15</span>How can what is fully shared be withheld and then revealed?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"The creative power of God and His creations is limitless, but they are not in reciprocal relationship.
