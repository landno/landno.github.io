data-sentence-id=\"058#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who want peace can find it only by complete forgiveness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>No learning is acquired by anyone unless he wants to learn it and believes in some way that he needs it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>While lack does not exist in the creation of God, it is very apparent in what you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is, in fact, the essential difference between them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Lack implies that you would be better off in a state somehow different from the one you are in.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Until the “separation,” which is the meaning of the “fall,” nothing was lacking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>There were no needs at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Needs arise only when you deprive yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>You act according to the particular order of needs you establish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>This, in turn, depends on your perception of what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"058#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>A sense of separation from God is the only lack you really need correct.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This sense of separation would never have arisen if you had not distorted your perception of truth, and had thus perceived yourself as lacking.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The idea of order of needs arose because, having made this fundamental error, you had already fragmented yourself into levels with different needs.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>As you integrate you become one, and your needs become one accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Unified needs lead to unified action, because this produces a lack of conflict.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"058#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The idea of orders of need, which follows from the original error that one can be separated from God, requires correction at its own level before the error of perceiving levels at all can be corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You cannot behave effectively while you function on different levels.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>However, while you do, correction must be introduced vertically from the bottom up.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is because you think you live in space, where concepts such as “up” and “down” are meaningful.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Ultimately, space is as meaningless as time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Both are merely beliefs.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"058#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The real purpose of this world is to use it to correct your unbelief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You can never control the effects of fear yourself, because you made fear, and you believe in what you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In attitude, then, though not in content, you resemble your Creator, Who has perfect faith in His creations <i>because</i> He created them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Belief produces the acceptance of existence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>That is why you can believe what no one else thinks is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is true for you because it was made by you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"058#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>All aspects of fear are untrue because they do not exist at the creative level, and therefore do not exist at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>To whatever extent you are willing to submit your beliefs to this test, to that extent are your perceptions corrected.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In sorting out the false from the true, the miracle proceeds along these lines:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Perfect love casts out fear.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>If fear exists, then there is not perfect love.</span></p> <p class=\"p-centered\"><span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Only perfect love exists.<br/></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>If there is fear, it produces a state that does not exist.</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Believe this and you will be free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"058#5:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Only God can establish this solution, and this faith <i>is</i> His gift.</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"You who want peace can find it only by complete forgiveness.
