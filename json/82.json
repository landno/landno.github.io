data-sentence-id=\"082#1:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is hard to understand what “The Kingdom of Heaven is within you” really means.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is because it is not understandable to the ego, which interprets it as if something outside is inside, and this does not mean anything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The word “within” is unnecessary.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The Kingdom of Heaven <i>is</i> you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What else <i>but</i> you did the Creator create, and what else <i>but</i> you is His Kingdom?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>This is the whole message of the Atonement; a message which in its totality transcends the sum of its parts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You, too, have a Kingdom that your spirit created.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>It has not ceased to create because of the ego’s illusions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Your creations are no more fatherless than you are.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>Your ego and your spirit will never be co-creators, but your spirit and your Creator will always be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:11\"><span class=\"snr\">11</span>Be confident that your creations are as safe as you are.</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:12\"><span class=\"snr\">12</span>The Kingdom is perfectly united and perfectly protected, and the ego will not prevail against it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#1:13\"><span class=\"snr\">13</span>Amen.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"082#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>This is written in the form of a prayer because it is useful in moments of temptation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is a declaration of independence.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will find it very helpful if you understand it fully.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The reason you need my help is because you have denied your own Guide and therefore need guidance.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>My role is to separate the true from the false, so truth can break through the barriers the ego has set up and can shine into your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Against our united strength the ego cannot prevail.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"082#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is surely apparent by now why the ego regards spirit as its “enemy.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego arose from the separation, and its continued existence depends on your continuing belief in the separation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The ego must offer you some sort of reward for maintaining this belief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>All it can offer is a sense of temporary existence, which begins with its own beginning and ends with its own ending.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It tells you this life is your existence because it is its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Against this sense of temporary existence spirit offers you the knowledge of permanence and unshakable being.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>No one who has experienced the revelation of this can ever fully believe in the ego again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#3:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>How can its meager offering to you prevail against the glorious gift of God?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"082#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>You who identify with your ego cannot believe God loves you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You do not love what you made, and what you made does not love you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Being made out of the denial of the Father, the ego has no allegiance to its maker.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot conceive of the real relationship that exists between God and His creations because of your hatred for the self you made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You project onto the ego the decision to separate, and this conflicts with the love you feel for the ego because you made it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>No love in this world is without this ambivalence, and since no ego has experienced love without ambivalence the concept is beyond its understanding.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Love will enter immediately into any mind that truly wants it, but it must want it truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>This means that it wants it without ambivalence, and this kind of wanting is wholly without the ego’s “drive to get.”</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"082#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is a kind of experience so different from anything the ego can offer that you will never want to cover or hide it again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is necessary to repeat that your belief in darkness and hiding is why the light cannot enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Bible gives many references to the immeasurable gifts which are for you, but for which you must ask.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This is not a condition as the ego sets conditions.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is the glorious condition of what you are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"082#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>No force except your own will is strong enough or worthy enough to guide you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>In this you are as free as God, and must remain so forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Let us ask the Father in my name to keep you mindful of His Love for you and yours for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>He has never failed to answer this request, because it asks only for what He has already willed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Those who call truly are always answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Thou shalt have no other gods before Him because there <i>are</i> none.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"082#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It has never really entered your mind to give up every idea you ever had that opposes knowledge.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You retain thousands of little scraps of fear that prevent the Holy One from entering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Light cannot penetrate through the walls you make to block it, and it is forever unwilling to destroy what you have made.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No one can see through a wall, but I can step around it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Watch your mind for the scraps of fear, or you will be unable to ask me to do so.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>I can help you only as our Father created us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I will love you and honor you and maintain complete respect for what you have made, but I will not uphold it unless it is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I will never forsake you any more than God will, but I must wait as long as you choose to forsake yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>Because I wait in love and not in impatience, you will surely ask me truly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#7:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>I will come in response to a single unequivocal call.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"082#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Watch carefully and see what it is you are really asking for.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Be very honest with yourself in this, for we must hide nothing from each other.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you will really try to do this, you have taken the first step toward preparing your mind for the Holy One to enter.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>We will prepare for this together, for once He has come, you will be ready to help me make other minds ready for Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>How long will you deny Him His Kingdom?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"082#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>In your own mind, though denied by the ego, is the declaration of your release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span><i>God has given you everything.</i></span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This one fact means the ego does not exist, and this makes it profoundly afraid.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In the ego’s language, “to have” and “to be” are different, but they are identical to the Holy Spirit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Holy Spirit knows that you both <i>have</i> everything and <i>are</i> everything.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Any distinction in this respect is meaningful only when the idea of “getting,” which implies a lack, has already been accepted.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>That is why we make no distinction between <i>having</i> the Kingdom of God and <i>being</i> the Kingdom of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"082#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The calm being of God’s Kingdom, which in your sane mind is perfectly conscious, is ruthlessly banished from the part of the mind the ego rules.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>The ego is desperate because it opposes literally invincible odds, whether you are asleep or awake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Consider how much vigilance you have been willing to exert to protect your ego, and how little to protect your right mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"082#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Who but the insane would undertake to believe what is not true, and then protect this belief at the cost of truth?</span></p></div> </div>","firstWords":"It is hard to understand what “The Kingdom of Heaven is within you” really means.
