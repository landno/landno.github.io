<div id="title">Preface:How It Came</div>
<div class="acim-text preface-1"> <div data-paragraph-id="041#1"><p class="p-normal"><span class="pnr noprint">1</span><span data-sentence-id="041#1:1"><span class="snr noprint">1</span><i>A Course in Miracles</i> began with the sudden decision of two people to join in a common goal.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#1:2"><span class="snr noprint">2</span>Their names were Helen Schucman and William Thetford, Professors of Medical Psychology at Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#1:3"><span class="snr noprint">3</span>It does not matter who they were, except that the story shows that with God all things are possible.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#1:4"><span class="snr noprint">4</span>They were anything but spiritual.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#1:5"><span class="snr noprint">5</span>Their relationship with each other was difficult and often strained, and they were concerned with personal and professional acceptance and status.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#1:6"><span class="snr noprint">6</span>In general, they had considerable investment in the values of the world.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#1:7"><span class="snr noprint">7</span>Their lives were hardly in accord with anything that the Course advocates. Helen, the one who received the material, describes herself:</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id="041#2"><p class="p-quote p-italic"><span class="pnr noprint">2</span><span data-sentence-id="041#2:1"><span class="snr noprint">1</span>Psychologist, educator, conservative in theory and atheistic in belief, I was working in a prestigious and highly academic setting.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#2:2"><span class="snr noprint">2</span>And then something happened that triggered a chain of events I could never have predicted.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#2:3"><span class="snr noprint">3</span>The head of my department unexpectedly announced that he was tired of the angry and aggressive feelings our attitudes reflected, and concluded that “there must be another way.”</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#2:4"><span class="snr noprint">4</span>As if on cue, I agreed to help him find it.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#2:5"><span class="snr noprint">5</span>Apparently this Course is the other way.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id="041#3"><p class="p-normal"><span class="pnr noprint">3</span><span data-sentence-id="041#3:1"><span class="snr noprint">1</span>Although their intention was serious, they had great difficulty in starting out on their joint venture.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#3:2"><span class="snr noprint">2</span>But they had given the Holy Spirit the “little willingness” that, as the Course itself was to emphasize again and again, is sufficient to enable Him to use any situation for His purposes and provide it with His power.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id="041#4"><p class="p-normal"><span class="pnr noprint">4</span><span data-sentence-id="041#4:1"><span class="snr noprint">1</span>To continue Helen’s first-person account:</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id="041#5"><p class="p-quote p-italic"><span class="pnr noprint">5</span><span data-sentence-id="041#5:1"><span class="snr noprint">1</span>Three startling months preceded the actual writing, during which time Bill suggested that I write down the highly symbolic dreams and descriptions of the strange images that were coming to me.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:2"><span class="snr noprint">2</span>Although I had grown more accustomed to the unexpected by that time, I was still very surprised when I wrote, “This is a course in miracles.”</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:3"><span class="snr noprint">3</span>That was my introduction to the Voice.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:4"><span class="snr noprint">4</span>It made no sound, but seemed to be giving me a kind of rapid, inner dictation which I took down in a shorthand notebook.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:5"><span class="snr noprint">5</span>The writing was never automatic.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:6"><span class="snr noprint">6</span>It could be interrupted at any time and later picked up again.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:7"><span class="snr noprint">7</span>It made me very uncomfortable, but it never seriously occurred to me to stop.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:8"><span class="snr noprint">8</span>It seemed to be a special assignment I had somehow, somewhere agreed to complete.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:9"><span class="snr noprint">9</span>It represented a truly collaborative venture between Bill and myself, and much of its significance, I am sure, lies in that.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:10"><span class="snr noprint">10</span>I would take down what the Voice “said” and read it to him the next day, and he typed it from my dictation.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:11"><span class="snr noprint">11</span>I expect he had his special assignment, too.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:12"><span class="snr noprint">12</span>Without his encouragement and support I would never have been able to fulfill mine.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:13"><span class="snr noprint">13</span>The whole process took about seven years.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:14"><span class="snr noprint">14</span>The Text came first, then the Workbook for Students, and finally the Manual for Teachers.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:15"><span class="snr noprint">15</span>Only a few minor changes have been made.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:16"><span class="snr noprint">16</span>Chapter titles and subheadings have been inserted in the Text, and some of the more personal references that occurred at the beginning have been omitted.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#5:17"><span class="snr noprint">17</span>Otherwise the material is substantially unchanged.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id="041#6"><p class="p-normal"><span class="pnr noprint">6</span><span data-sentence-id="041#6:1"><span class="snr noprint">1</span>The names of the collaborators in the recording of the Course do not appear on the cover because the Course can and should stand on its own.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#6:2"><span class="snr noprint">2</span>It is not intended to become the basis for another cult.</span> <span data-sentence-id="041#6:3"><span class="snr noprint">3</span>Its only purpose is to provide a way in which some people will be able to find their own Internal Teacher.</span></p></div> </div>
